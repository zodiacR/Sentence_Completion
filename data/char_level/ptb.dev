<s> But what about those of us whose views *T*-2 are not UNK *-1 by formula or UNK ? </s>
<s> How should we think about national service *T*-1 ? </s>
<s> * Let 's begin by *-1 UNK a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning . </s>
<s> UNK service be voluntary or UNK ? </s>
<s> Short or long ? </s>
<s> UNK or full-time ? </s>
<s> UNK or unpaid ? </s>
<s> UNK participants live at home and work nearby or live in UNK and work on public UNK ? </s>
<s> What kinds of work would they do *T*-1 ? </s>
<s> What does `` national '' mean *T*-1 ? </s>
<s> UNK the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ? </s>
<s> And who *T*-1 would serve ? </s>
<s> Only males , as with the draft , or both UNK ? </s>
<s> UNK only or all UNK ? </s>
<s> UNK people , or poor people , or a genuine UNK ? </s>
<s> Many or few ? </s>
<s> Those are not UNK questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them . </s>
<s> Then how should we think about national service *T*-1 ? </s>
<s> As a starting point , here are five UNK : 1 . * Consider the UNK , not the name . </s>
<s> * UNK `` national service '' in the UNK ; * consider specific proposals . </s>
<s> They will differ in crucial ways . </s>
<s> 2 . `` Service '' should be service . </s>
<s> As * commonly understood *-1 , service implies sacrifice . </s>
<s> It involves * accepting risk , or * giving up income , or * UNK a career . </s>
<s> It follows that proposals like UNK , whose benefits to UNK *T*-1 are worth some $ UNK *U* a year , do not qualify . </s>
<s> There is a UNK for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a UNK Bill without the UNK '' ; UNK those benefits should be earned *-1 , not given *-1 . </s>
<s> But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school UNK with full-time jobs . </s>
<s> Why * call that service ? </s>
<s> 3 . UNK is fine ; UNK is not *?* . </s>
<s> UNK service is unconstitutional . </s>
<s> It is also UNK and UNK . </s>
<s> -LRB- Who *T*-1 will throw several hundred thousand UNK in jail each year ? -RRB- </s>
<s> But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government UNK many kinds of behavior . </s>
<s> It should also encourage service -- UNK by all classes and all UNK . </s>
<s> Its encouragement should strengthen *RNR*-1 and not undercut *RNR*-1 the strong tradition of UNK in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local UNK about which tasks *T*-2 most need doing . </s>
<s> 4 . Good programs are not cheap . </s>
<s> UNK assume that national service would get important work done UNK : forest fires fought *-1 , housing UNK *-2 , students UNK *-3 , UNK centers UNK *-4 . </s>
<s> There is important work 0 *T*-3 to be done *-1 , and existing service and conservation UNK have shown that even UNK who *T*-2 start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not UNK . </s>
<s> Good service programs require UNK , UNK , training and UNK -- all of high quality . </s>
<s> They involve UNK to participants . </s>
<s> UNK residential programs also require housing and full-time UNK ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale . </s>
<s> UNK programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 *U* a year . </s>
<s> Are they worth that ? </s>
<s> UNK suggest that good ones are *?* -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted *-1 . </s>
<s> But the calculations are UNK . </s>
<s> 5 . UNK youth are a special concern . </s>
<s> Are such expenditures UNK , then ? </s>
<s> Yes , if * targeted *-1 . </s>
<s> People of all UNK and all classes should be encouraged *-1 to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their UNK , to serve at little public cost . </s>
<s> They can volunteer at any of thousands of UNK institutions , or participate in service programs required * by high schools or encouraged * by colleges or employers . </s>
<s> UNK youth do n't have those opportunities . </s>
<s> They are not UNK in high school or college . </s>
<s> They are unlikely * to be employed *-1 . </s>
<s> And they have grown up in UNK grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , *-1 UNK by UNK UNK and bleak prospects . </s>
<s> But many of them can be quite UNK UNK *-1 by UNK and disciplined service . </s>
<s> Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons . </s>
<s> But some whom nothing else is reaching *T*-2 are UNK *-1 . </s>
<s> * Learning skills , producing something UNK , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them . </s>
<s> Even if it *EXP*-1 is cheaper * to build UNK or UNK apartments or plant UNK with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the UNK . </s>
<s> * UNK speaking , these youth are not performing service . </s>
<s> They are giving up no income , UNK no careers , UNK no risk . </s>
<s> But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin *-1 to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future . </s>
<s> That is a service to the nation . </s>
<s> It is what federal support should try hardest *-2 to achieve *T*-1 . </s>

<s> But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters . </s>
<s> In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that * avoiding UNK actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout . </s>
<s> `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything 0 you do *T*-2 that *T*-1 looks like you are doing too much tends *-4 to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said *T*-3 one government official , insisting on UNK . </s>
<s> The Fed 's efforts at UNK were partly UNK *-1 Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories UNK a senior Fed official saying 0 the central bank was prepared * to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised *-1 by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted 0 he had n't authorized any public comment . </s>

<s> `` One possibility is that this is a UNK setback , reasonably limited in its UNK , and not a major problem , '' said *T*-2 one senior administration official , who also *T*-3 asked that he not be named *-1 . </s>

<s> One strategy for investors who *T*-1 want *-3 to stay in but hedge their UNK is * to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual stocks 0 they own *T*-2 or on a broad market index . </s>
<s> A put option gives its holder the right -LRB- but not the obligation -RRB- * to sell a stock -LRB- or stock index -RRB- for a specified price -LRB- the strike price -RRB- until the option expires . </s>
<s> Whether this insurance is UNK depends on the cost of an option . </s>

<s> Goldman officials declined *-1 to comment . </s>
<s> Junk bonds , which *T*-1 UNK from less than $ 2 billion *U* at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments . </s>
<s> The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which *T*-1 created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing . </s>
<s> Campeau developed a cash squeeze that *T*-1 caused it to be UNK on some interest payments and to put its prestigious UNK department-store chain up for sale . </s>
<s> Now , dozens of corporations , including UNK Allen , TW Services and York International , that *T*-1 are counting on at least $ 7 billion *U* of scheduled new junk financings *-2 to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs UNK , may never get the money . </s>

<s> Indeed , a Moody 's index that *T*-1 tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the UNK consecutive day Friday . </s>
<s> In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 *U* for each $ 1,000 *U* face amount , to 103 UNK , its biggest gain of the year . </s>
<s> The bond 's yield dropped to UNK % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to UNK Data Global Markets Group . </s>
<s> The yield on three-month Treasury bills , considered the UNK of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to UNK % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 . </s>

<s> `` When you get panic in one market *T*-1 , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said *T*-2 Maria UNK , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </s>

<s> Any sustained UNK could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities . </s>

<s> There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . '' </s>
<s> Even as trading in high-yield issues UNK up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion *U* of new junk bonds . </s>

<s> But such highly leveraged transactions seemed *-1 to have UNK this year , * casting a pall over much of the junk market . </s>

<s> `` Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says *T*-1 . </s>
<s> `` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six . </s>
<s> And our credit standards have n't changed one UNK . '' </s>
<s> However , Mr. UNK said 0 the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers . </s>
<s> For the moment , investors seem more UNK with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . </s>
<s> `` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , says *T*-1 Mr. UNK of Merrill Lynch . </s>

<s> Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was UNK through one of its worst years ever . </s>
<s> Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , * UNK by a seemingly UNK trail of bad news : </s>
<s> -- In June , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion *U* of speculative debt securities , New York-based Integrated Resources Inc. said 0 it ran out of borrowed money . </s>
<s> -- In July , UNK Corp. , the UNK real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion *U* of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law . </s>
<s> -- By the end of July , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points . </s>
<s> -- In August , UNK International Inc. , which *T*-1 sold more than $ 500 million *U* of junk bonds , suspended interest payments . </s>
<s> -- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , UNK Financial Corp. UNK on $ 145 million *U* of notes and appeared unlikely *-1 to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion *U* of debt securities . </s>
<s> UNK , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of *-1 UNK . </s>
<s> Moody 's says 0 the UNK of corporate credit UNK is the highest this year since 1982 . </s>
<s> In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . </s>

<s> Friday 's Market Activity </s>
<s> Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a UNK stock market . </s>
<s> The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted *-1 6 p.m. EDT at 103 UNK , compared * with 100 UNK Thursday , up 2 1\/2 points . </s>
<s> The yield on the benchmark fell to UNK % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to UNK Data Global Markets Group . </s>
<s> The `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a UNK fall in the stock market . </s>
<s> Treasurys opened lower , * reacting UNK to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in September . </s>
<s> Bond prices barely UNK until midday . </s>
<s> Many bond market participants will be closely UNK the action of the Federal Reserve , which *T*-1 might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity * to UNK the financial markets and keep the economy from *-2 slowing into a recession . </s>
<s> Prices of municipals , investment-grade UNK and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts . </s>
<s> Mortgage securities rose in UNK trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue . </s>
<s> The Ginnie Mae November 9 % issue ended at 98 UNK , up 7\/8 point on the day , * to yield about UNK % to a 12-year average life assumption . </s>
<s> Investment-grade corporate bonds were up about 1\/2 to 3\/4 point . </s>
<s> But the yield spread between UNK , investment-grade issues and UNK bonds widened . </s>
<s> And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion *U* bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority . </s>
<s> Despite rumors that the TVA 's UNK offering would be postponed *-1 because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said 0 they expect 0 the issue will be priced *-2 as * scheduled . </s>
<s> One of the sources said 0 the smaller portions of $ 750 million *U* each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially UNK *-1 . '' </s>
<s> Municipal bonds rose as much as 3\/4 point . </s>
<s> Roger UNK contributed to this article . </s>
<s> Friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come UNK the climate of anxiety that *T*-3 dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and UNK have been put *-2 in place * to keep markets more orderly . </s>
<s> Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was UNK *-1 by Washington . </s>
<s> The consensus along the street seems *-2 to be that the plunge was triggered *-1 by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true 0 the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt . </s>
<s> Still , the consensus *ICH*-2 seems almost as wide that one UNK bid is no reason 0 * to write down the value of all U.S. business *T*-1 . </s>
<s> This UNK leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones UNK shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in * UNK the capital gains tax cut . </s>
<s> The real value of all shares , after all , is directly UNK *-1 by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that *T*-2 show 0 gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- . </s>
<s> And market expectations clearly have been raised *-1 by the capital gains victory in the House last month . </s>
<s> An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped *-1 from the tax bill , * leaving it with $ 5.4 billion *U* in tax increases without a capital gains cut . </s>
<s> There is a great deal 0 *T*-2 to be said *-1 , * to be sure , for * UNK the UNK out of the reconciliation bill . </s>
<s> It would be a good thing if Congress started *-1 to decide issues UNK on their individual merits without UNK . </s>
<s> For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an UNK vote . </s>
<s> Since Senate leaders have so far UNK it up with procedural UNK , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect . </s>
<s> UNK so since President Bush has been weakened *-1 by the Panama UNK . </s>
<s> To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's UNK UNK . </s>
<s> As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are UNK *-1 of course , at some point the market will start *-2 to reject them . </s>
<s> But the airlines are UNK a clear case , * given anti-takeover UNK by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who *T*-2 UNK *-4 to believe 0 safety will be UNK *-1 if UNK and British Airways own interests in companies that *T*-3 fly airplanes . </s>
<s> Worse , Congress has started *-1 to jump on the Skinner UNK . </s>
<s> James UNK , the Minnesota Democrat who *T*-2 chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an UNK takeover bill on UNK speed so that it would be passed *-1 in time * to affect the American and United Air Lines bids . </s>
<s> It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days * to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion *U* or more . </s>
<s> So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points . </s>
<s> UNK , Mr. Secretary and Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> In the 1987 crash , * remember , the market was shaken *-1 by a UNK UNK proposal * to tax takeovers out of UNK . </s>
<s> Even more important , in our view , was *T*-1 the Treasury 's threat * to UNK the dollar . </s>
<s> The Treasury is doing the same thing today ; UNK , the dollar is not under UNK pressure . </s>
<s> Also , traders are in better shape *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 today than in 1987 * to survive selling UNK . </s>
<s> They are better capitalized *-1 . </s>
<s> They are in less danger of *-1 losing liquidity simply because of tape UNK and clearing and settlement delays . </s>
<s> The Fed promises any needed liquidity . </s>
<s> The Big Board 's UNK with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ; it *EXP*-1 will be interesting * to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove *-2 to be a good idea . </s>
<s> In any event , some traders see stocks as UNK today , unlike 1987 . </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with the market that *T*-2 ca n't be UNK *-1 by a little UNK and common sense in Washington . </s>
<s> But on the bearish side , that may be too much 0 * to expect *T*-1 . </s>
<s> First Chicago Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ UNK million *U* after *-1 joining other big banks in *-2 further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans . </s>
<s> The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion *U* in assets , said 0 it set aside $ 200 million *U* * to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries . </s>
<s> The addition , on top of two big 1987 UNK to UNK reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of UNK and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations . </s>
<s> First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion *U* from $ 3 billion *U* . </s>
<s> Despite this loss , First Chicago said 0 it does n't need *-1 to sell stock *-1 to raise capital . </s>
<s> During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ UNK million *U* from the sale of its First Chicago Investment UNK unit . </s>
<s> UNK foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ UNK million *U* from $ UNK million *U* . </s>
<s> UNK from First Chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy-out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million *U* from $ UNK million *U* a year ago . </s>
<s> Interest income and most fee income was strong . </s>
<s> Greece 's second UNK of general elections this year is slated *-1 for Nov. 5 . </s>
<s> For those hoping * to see a UNK of political UNK restored -- in view of Greece 's UNK UNK under UNK UNK and subsequent three-month UNK with a UNK coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still UNK former Prime Minister Andreas UNK and his fallen socialist government are like flies UNK around a UNK UNK . </s>
<s> In the UNK round of voting , UNK gave no clear mandate to any single political party . </s>
<s> The ad interim coalition government that *T*-1 emerged from UNK UNK was , in UNK , little more than the UNK UNK of ideological UNK : On one side , the UNK New UNK Party , headed * by UNK UNK . </s>
<s> On the other , the so-called UNK of the UNK and UNK -- a UNK and rather deceptive title for a merger of the UNK Communist Party of Greece and its UNK UNK , the UNK UNK . </s>
<s> The UNK bond for this UNK UNK was plain : UNK -LRB- Mr. UNK 's party -RRB- as common political enemy . </s>
<s> The UNK goal was a UNK of government corruption , UNK at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. UNK and his UNK associates . </s>
<s> In point of fact , this UNK was overdue by decades . </s>
<s> When * reduced to UNK status in UNK UNK UNK *T*-1 , however , the notion UNK into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice . </s>
<s> With regard to Greece 's UNK UNK scandal , Mr. UNK 's principal UNK remains George UNK , former owner of the Bank of UNK and UNK UNK , now UNK in a jail cell in UNK , Mass. , from where he is fighting UNK proceedings that *T*-1 would return him to Greece *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK 's credibility is , at best , UNK . </s>
<s> He has ample UNK * to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found *-1 less than UNK on numerous points . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the New UNK and Communist parties UNK his UNK as proof of UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Among UNK questions are *T*-3 whether Mr. UNK received $ 23 million *U* of stolen Bank of UNK funds and an additional $ UNK *U* in UNK , as * contended *-4 ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies *-5 to deposit some $ 57 million *U* in Mr. UNK 's bank and then UNK off the interest ; and , what UNK 's cut was *T*-1 from the $ UNK million *U* 0 Mr. UNK UNK *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Two former ministers were so heavily UNK in the UNK affair that UNK members of Parliament voted *-1 to refer them to the special court . </s>
<s> But UNK parliamentary probe was *T*-2 the case of millions of UNK 0 Mr. UNK UNK *T*-1 into New UNK UNK . </s>
<s> In the end , the investigation produced only UNK evidence and `` indications '' that *T*-1 point to UNK , not UNK proof . </s>
<s> On another issue , UNK were told *-1 how their national intelligence agency , the UNK , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and UNK cabinet members . </s>
<s> Despite convincing arguments , it was never established *-1 that Mr. UNK personally ordered or directed the UNK . </s>
<s> The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and UNK *T*-1 . </s>
<s> The coalition government tried *-1 to show that UNK ministers had received hefty sums for * UNK the purchase of UNK UNK Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced * by the UNK General Dynamics Corp. and France 's UNK UNK UNK , respectively . </s>
<s> UNK , neither General Dynamics nor UNK could be expected *-1 to UNK its prospective future dealings by *-2 making disclosures of sums paid * -LRB- or not -RRB- to various UNK officials for services UNK * . </s>
<s> So it seems that Mr. UNK and his communist UNK may have UNK served Mr. UNK a moral victory on a UNK : UNK , whether guilty or not , can now UNK the UNK * UNK the whole affair as a UNK UNK at Mr. UNK 's expense . </s>
<s> But while UNK high UNK alone wo n't help UNK regain power , Mr. UNK should never be underestimated *-1 . </s>
<s> First came *T*-1 his predictable UNK : He charged 0 the UNK of the UNK and UNK had sold out its leftist UNK by * UNK in a UNK plot aimed * at * UNK UNK and UNK the course of socialism in Greece . </s>
<s> Then , *-1 to UNK his credibility with the left , he UNK some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Next , he continued *-2 to court the UNK -- many of whom *T*-1 feel UNK by the UNK coalition 's birth -- by * bringing into UNK a UNK Communist Party candidate . </s>
<s> For balance , and in hopes of *-1 gaining some UNK UNK votes , he managed *-1 to attract a former New UNK Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> Thus UNK heads for the polls not only with diminished UNK , but also with `` UNK of approval '' from representatives of its UNK UNK . </s>
<s> UNK as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the UNK . </s>
<s> The country 's future NATO participation remains UNK , for instance . </s>
<s> Greece also must UNK major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation . </s>
<s> Greece 's UNK relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well . </s>
<s> For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece UNK in May 1990 . </s>
<s> UNK for a new agreement were frozen *-1 before the June elections , but the UNK is running . </s>
<s> Another matter of concern is the UNK of UNK UNK , a Palestinian UNK who *T*-2 is wanted *-1 in the U.S. for the 1982 UNK of a Pan American Airways flight . </s>
<s> The UNK courts have decided in favor of UNK in the UNK case , but the matter UNK final approval from Greece 's next justice minister . </s>
<s> The UNK seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a UNK test of whether Greece will be counted *-1 in or out for international efforts * to combat terrorism . </s>
<s> That UNK could win the elections outright is UNK ; the UNK press , previously eager * to UNK off UNK 's line , has turned on Mr. UNK with a UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Yet the possibility of another UNK government is all too real . </s>
<s> If Mr. UNK becomes the major opposition leader , he could UNK a UNK coalition . </s>
<s> Also , he could force new elections early next year by * UNK the procedures for the election of the president of the UNK in March . </s>
<s> New UNK has once again UNK underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against UNK , * UNK *-1 to tend to either program UNK or the UNK of internal UNK . </s>
<s> As for Mr. UNK ? </s>
<s> He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage . </s>
