<s> At the same time , its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ 240 million *U* , largely because of debt taken * on * to pay a $ UNK *U* special dividend earlier this year . </s>

<s> And it has remained there , as * UNK *-2 by its UNK in a 1972 CBS UNK called * `` UNK UNK UNK , '' whose sole UNK *T*-1 was that it led to the UNK marriage of Meredith UNK and David UNK . </s>
<s> Clearly , the question with `` Chicken Soup '' is not whether the UNK will UNK over , but whether it will UNK at all . </s>
<s> So far , the UNK have been few and far between . </s>
<s> Part of the problem is the tendency *ICH*-1 of all UNK , ever since the UNK days of Norman UNK , * to UNK about social issues . </s>
<s> To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries *-2 to UNK us about ethnic UNK by *-3 UNK them *T*-1 . </s>

<s> The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end -LRB- and occasionally in the middle -RRB- , when Mr. Mason UNK into his UNK UNK *T*-2 and starts *-1 UNK out that old-fashioned Jewish UNK to other people as well as to himself *T*-2 . </s>
<s> But too often , these UNK lack spark because this UNK , like all UNK , is UNK about *-1 UNK Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences . </s>

<s> The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be UNK , in any criminal case , *-1 to be a witness against himself . '' </s>
<s> This privilege against UNK UNK the drawing of an adverse UNK against a criminal defendant who *T*-3 chooses not *-1 to testify . </s>
<s> Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure * to testify nor can the defendant be UNK *-1 to take the stand as a witness , thus * forcing him to `` take the Fifth . '' </s>
<s> The privilege , however , has been limited in UNK with its plain language *-1 to protect the defendant in criminal matters only . </s>
<s> The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not UNK the UNK where the privilege is claimed *-1 by a party to a civil cause *T*-2 . '' </s>
<s> UNK v. UNK , UNK U.S. UNK -LRB- 1976 -RRB- . </s>
<s> Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called *-1 as a witness , he may be forced *-2 to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse UNK against him in the civil matter . </s>
<s> He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith *EXP*-1 and UNK belief *EXP*-1 that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . </s>
<s> * UNK the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based *-2 on a constitutional right * to refuse *-3 to testify where one 's testimony UNK him in the civil matter *T*-4 , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be UNK used *-1 against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . </s>
<s> UNK the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant *-1 to testify . </s>
<s> Thus , when Mr. UNK asserted the Fifth in a UNK proceeding , particularly after *-2 UNK receiving extensive advice from legal counsel *T*-3 , one must conclude that he held a UNK , UNK belief that his testimony could be used *-1 against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . </s>
<s> The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right * to draw the adverse UNK and to UNK with Mr. UNK 's own belief that his testimony could help *-1 UNK him of a crime . </s>

<s> UNK of those during the 1987 crash -- that as stock prices plummeted and trading activity UNK , some phone calls to market makers in over-the-counter stocks went UNK . </s>
<s> `` We could n't get dealers to answer their phones , '' said *T*-1 Robert King , senior vice president of OTC trading at UNK Co. in Atlanta . </s>
<s> `` It was -LCB- like -RCB- the Friday before Black Monday '' two years ago . </s>
<s> Whether UNK phone calls had any effect or not , Nasdaq stocks sank far less than those on the New York and American exchanges . </s>

<s> Most of the complaints about UNK phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors . </s>
<s> Mr. King of UNK and others were quick *-1 to add that they believe 0 the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability * to handle the volume of calls , rather than a UNK attempt * to avoid *-2 making trades . </s>
<s> The subject is a UNK one for Nasdaq and its UNK companies , which *T*-3 were widely criticized *-1 two years ago following complaints from investors who *T*-2 could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash . </s>
<s> Peter DaPuzzo , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , declared : 0 `` It was the last hour of trading on a Friday . </s>

<s> Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand *-2 to maintain orderly trading when imbalances occur *T*-1 . </s>
<s> On days like Friday , that means 0 they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing *-2 to *?* *T*-1 . </s>
<s> When selling is so UNK *T*-1 , prices fall UNK and fast . </s>
<s> Two years ago , *-2 faced *-1 with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began *-2 UNK shares , *-2 UNK the slide in OTC stock prices . </s>
<s> On Friday , some market makers were selling again , traders said 0 *T*-1 . </s>

<s> * Consider this : </s>
<s> -- By UNK p.m. tonight , President Bush must order $ 16 billion *U* of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending *-1 to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law . </s>
<s> The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed *-1 to reach agreement on a UNK bill . </s>
<s> `` We simply do n't have strong leadership 0 *T*-2 to try *-3 to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman UNK UNK -LRB- D. , Calif . -RRB- said *T*-1 yesterday on NBC News 's `` * UNK the Press . '' </s>
<s> -- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged *-1 in a UNK battle over international economic policy . </s>
<s> The administration has been trying *-1 to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been UNK . </s>
<s> `` One of the things that *T*-1 continues *-3 to worry me is this monetary UNK between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said *T*-2 Lawrence UNK , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This Week . '' </s>
<s> -- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent UNK of airline takeovers . </s>
<s> Last month , Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held * by UNK Royal Dutch Airlines . </s>
<s> But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision . </s>
<s> And he has kept UNK on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which *T*-1 includes a big stake by British Airways PLC *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Some analysts say 0 uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through *T*-2 -- the event that *T*-1 triggered the market drop . </s>
<s> In many ways , the UNK to Friday 's stock decline is UNK similar to that of October 1987 's UNK crash . </s>
<s> Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of *-1 taking hold . </s>
<s> The Treasury was locked *-1 in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve . </s>
<s> And concern about official actions aimed * at takeovers -- then by the UNK House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous . </s>
<s> The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , * resulting in a two-year plan * to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion *U* -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion *U* during that period . </s>
<s> But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year . </s>
<s> Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough * to force both sides back to the table *-2 to try *-3 to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that *T*-1 would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's UNK plan , which *T*-4 still is n't fully implemented *-5 . </s>
<s> One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely *-1 to come about *T*-2 is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day UNK tumble . </s>
<s> `` Everybody thought 0 we were looking at a UNK of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. UNK said *T*-1 yesterday in an interview . </s>
<s> `` That did not happen . </s>
<s> They learned 0 they could survive it without much problem . '' </s>
<s> But administration officials privately agree with Mr. UNK , who *T*-1 said 0 a UNK drop this week `` is going *-2 to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . '' </s>
<s> In that case , there will be plenty of blame 0 *T*-1 to go around . </s>
<s> `` There is an underlying concern *ICH*-5 on the part of the American people -- and there should be *?* - that the administration has not gone far enough in *-1 cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling *-2 to cut what the administration asked us *-4 to cut *T*-3 , '' said *T*-6 Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd UNK -LRB- D. , Texas -RRB- . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline * to overcome the bitter feelings that *T*-1 have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight . </s>
<s> Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on * combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation . </s>
<s> `` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell -LRB- D. , Maine -RRB- said *T*-1 yesterday on CBS News 's `` * UNK the UNK . '' </s>
<s> During last week 's UNK on the UNK bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . </s>
<s> At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal 0 *T*-1 to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation *T*-2 , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it *EXP*-3 was the president 's policy * to include it . </s>
<s> When an agreement *ICH*-1 was reached *-3 * to strip capital gains from the legislation *T*-2 , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the UNK Senate Finance Committee , hailed it . </s>
<s> *-2 Asked *-1 if the administration agreed , he UNK replied : 0 `` The UNK will have *-3 to speak for itself . '' </s>
<s> Friday 's market tumble could spur action on * UNK the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that *T*-1 is n't expected *-2 to begin until tomorrow at the UNK . </s>
<s> Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which *T*-1 on Friday agreed *-2 to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that *T*-4 would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . </s>
<s> `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way 0 * to do that *T*-1 is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren UNK -LRB- R. , UNK . -RRB- . said 0 *T*-2 yesterday . </s>
<s> The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations *T*-2 determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met *-1 , estimated that the UNK deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 UNK by $ 6.2 billion *U* , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ UNK billion *U* . </s>
<s> Rep. UNK said that UNK 's figure would still be enough * to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : 0 `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . '' </s>
<s> No one in Washington was willing *-1 to take the blame for * UNK Friday 's drop in the stock market . </s>
<s> But some players were quick *-1 to seize the moment . </s>
<s> Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard UNK , the UNK chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement UNK the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision * to postpone action on capital gains . </s>
<s> `` Investors , who *T*-1 had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time 0 * to sell *T*-4 , were UNK *-3 , '' he said *T*-2 . </s>
<s> `` There have been many UNK reasons *ICH*-1 advanced * * to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said *T*-2 during his television appearance , `` but I suggest 0 that is perhaps more than any of the others . </s>

<s> This may sound UNK optimistic . </s>
<s> After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed *-1 as a barometer of the national economy . </s>
<s> When it went down *T*-1 , by all tradition , the economy followed . </s>
<s> That has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable . </s>
<s> The 1987 crash was `` a false alarm however you view it *T*-1 , '' says 0 *T*-2 University of Chicago economist Victor UNK . </s>
<s> The market seems increasingly UNK from the rest of the nation . </s>

<s> Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened *-1 if the market continues *-2 to dive this week . </s>
<s> UNK falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies *T*-1 for financial UNK . </s>

<s> Growth is slower . </s>
<s> Profits are softer . </s>
<s> UNK burdens are UNK . </s>
<s> But if the stock market does n't continue *-1 to UNK , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . </s>
<s> The Fed , which *T*-1 until Friday had been UNK moves 0 *T*-2 to ease credit , is now poised *-3 to pour money into the economy if * needed *-4 *-5 to UNK the markets . </s>
<s> Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies . </s>

<s> *-1 UNK the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known * as the Federal Funds rate to UNK % *ICH*-2 late Friday , down from UNK % the day before . </s>

<s> The dollar also began *-2 to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to UNK their desire * to invest in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of UNK with economic fundamentals , *-2 threatening *-3 to UNK the export boom that *T*-1 has sustained manufacturers for several years . </s>

<s> What *T*-1 's more , the corporate borrowing UNK has n't UNK in the past two years . </s>
<s> `` We 've had two more years of significant UNK of debt ... just at the time when earnings are being squeezed *-1 *T*-3 , '' Mr. UNK notes *T*-2 . </s>
<s> The more a company relies on borrowed money , the greater its UNK to an economic slowdown . </s>
<s> A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm ; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court . </s>
<s> The Fed , of course , knows that very well -- hence its UNK * to pump credit into the economy this morning . </s>
<s> But , in the process , the Fed risks *-1 UNK inflation . </s>
<s> Even before Friday 's events , Harvard University economist Benjamin UNK was arguing that the Fed wo n't be able *-1 to live up to its tough words on * eliminating inflation because of its responsibility * to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations . </s>
<s> The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons 0 *T*-1 ; it 's an UNK of UNK inflation . </s>
<s> In the end , the 1987 collapse suggested 0 *T*-1 , the economy does n't move in UNK with stock prices . </s>
<s> The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors . </s>
<s> A panic on Wall Street does n't exactly UNK confidence . </s>
<s> UNK suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday . </s>
<s> A 190-point drop is n't likely *-1 to make much of a UNK ; * UNK that a few times over , though , and it will *?* . </s>
<s> If the reactions of executives gathered * Saturday at UNK Springs , Va. , for the Business Council meetings are typical , business leaders were n't overly UNK *-1 by Friday 's decline . </s>
<s> And if foreign investors become a UNK more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it . </s>
<s> On the bottom line , the most UNK fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before . </s>
<s> Two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent UNK . </s>
