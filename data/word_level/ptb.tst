<s> Government officials here and in other countries laid plans through the weekend to head off a Monday market UNK -- but went out of their way to keep their moves quiet . </s>
<s> Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the UNK , making it clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared to UNK massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed to prevent a financial crisis . </s>
<s> And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David UNK carefully UNK data on the Friday market plunge . </s>
<s> But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters . </s>
<s> In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that avoiding UNK actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's UNK . </s>
<s> `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything you do that looks like you are doing too much tends to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said one government official , insisting on UNK . </s>
<s> The Fed 's efforts at UNK were partly UNK Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories UNK a senior Fed official saying the central bank was prepared to UNK cash into the banking system Monday morning . </s>
<s> Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised by both stories , according to UNK sources , and insisted he had n't authorized any public comment . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged the stories were reasonably accurate UNK of the central bank 's game plan . </s>
<s> It is prepared to assume the same role it played in October 1987 , providing money to the markets if necessary to keep the financial system UNK . </s>
<s> The Fed provides money to the banking system by buying government securities from financial institutions . </s>
<s> The UNK of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC 's `` This UNK . '' </s>
<s> `` Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact . </s>
<s> I 'm sure they 'll do what 's right , what 's prudent , what 's UNK , '' he said . </s>
<s> When it was suggested his comment was a `` UNK , '' Mr. Darman replied : `` It is a UNK . </s>
<s> But , in this context , that 's the smart thing to do . '' </s>
<s> At the Treasury , Secretary Brady issued a statement UNK the stock market 's drop . </s>
<s> `` Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` The economy remains UNK , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' </s>
<s> But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week . </s>
<s> `` One possibility is that this is a UNK setback , reasonably limited in its UNK , and not a major problem , '' said one senior administration official , who also asked that he not be named . </s>
<s> `` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago . </s>
<s> I think that 's less likely . '' </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , monitoring events as they UNK in markets around the world . </s>
<s> The action was expected to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe . </s>
<s> Both the Treasury and the Fed planned to keep market rooms operating throughout the night to monitor the developments . </s>
<s> In Tokyo , share prices dropped sharply by 1.7 % in early Monday morning trading . </s>
<s> After the initial slide , the market appeared to be turning around but by early afternoon was headed lower . </s>
<s> In the Bush administration , the lead is being taken by Treasury Secretary Brady , UNK Robert UNK and Assistant Secretary UNK . </s>
<s> The three men worked together on the so-called Brady Commission , headed by Mr. Brady , which was established after the 1987 crash to examine the market 's collapse . </s>
<s> As a result they have extensive knowledge in financial markets , and financial market crises . </s>
<s> Mr. Brady was at the White House Friday afternoon when the stock market 's decline began . </s>
<s> He was quickly on the phone with Mr. UNK , who in turn was talking with the chairmen of the New York and Chicago exchanges . </s>
<s> Later , Mr. Brady UNK Mr. Greenspan , SEC Chairman Richard Breeden and numerous contacts in New York and overseas . </s>
<s> UNK say he continued to work the phones through the weekend . </s>
<s> Administration officials say President Bush was UNK throughout Friday afternoon and evening , even after leaving for UNK David . </s>
<s> He had frequent telephone UNK with Mr. Brady and Michael UNK , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers . </s>
<s> Government officials tried throughout the weekend to UNK a UNK appearance in order to avoid any sense of panic . </s>
<s> Treasury UNK David Mulford , for instance , was at a meeting of the Business Council in UNK Springs , Va. , when the stock market fell , and remained there through the following day . </s>
<s> And as of last night , Fed Chairman Greenspan had n't canceled his plans to address the American Bankers Association convention in Washington at 10 a.m. this morning . </s>
<s> Ironically , Mr. Greenspan was scheduled to address the same convention in Dallas on Oct. 20 , 1987 . </s>
<s> He flew to Dallas on Oct. 19 , when the market plummeted UNK points , but then turned around the next morning and returned to Washington without delivering his speech . </s>
<s> The Canadian government announced a new , 12-year Canada Savings Bond issue that will yield investors 10.5 % in the first year . </s>
<s> The annual interest rate for each of the next 11 years will be set each fall , when details of a new series are released . </s>
<s> Canada Savings Bonds are major government instruments for meeting its financial requirements . </s>
<s> The government has about UNK billion Canadian dollars ( US$ UNK billion ) of such bonds currently outstanding . </s>
<s> Only Canadian residents are permitted to buy Canada Savings Bonds , which may be redeemed any time at face value . </s>
<s> The bonds go on sale Oct. 19 . </s>
<s> The first major event this morning in U.S. stock and futures trading may be a UNK at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange . </s>
<s> Under a reform UNK from the 1987 crash , trading in the Merc 's stock-index futures will break for 10 minutes if the contract opens and stays five points from Friday 's close , a move equal to 40 points on the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> The aim of the UNK would be to ease the opening of the New York Stock Exchange , which would be UNK by such a volatile move on the Merc . </s>
<s> That UNK UNK is just one of a number of UNK adopted after the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> The Big Board also added computer capacity to handle huge UNK in trading volume . </s>
<s> Several of those UNK changes kicked in during Friday 's one-hour collapse and worked as expected , even though they did n't prevent a stunning plunge . </s>
<s> But the major `` circuit breakers '' have yet to be UNK . </s>
<s> A deeper market plunge today could give them their first test . </s>
<s> A further slide also would UNK debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash . </s>
<s> Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended by the Brady Task Force , which UNK the 1987 crash , would be revived -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . </s>
<s> The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved establishing a single UNK regulator to handle crucial UNK questions , such as setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . </s>
<s> But for the moment , attention UNK on the reforms that were put into place , and market regulators and participants said the circuit breakers worked as intended . </s>
<s> Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` UNK '' communications among exchanges . </s>
<s> Those UNK -- from UNK p.m. to UNK p.m. UNK and from UNK p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at or higher than their frozen levels . </s>
<s> During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's `` UNK '' computer program automatically was triggered . </s>
<s> That system is designed to separate UNK program trades from all other trades to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks . </s>
<s> One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two UNK to a fire at a UNK school . </s>
<s> `` You do n't want the fire but you know what to do , '' said Howard UNK , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor . </s>
<s> `` There was no panic . </s>
<s> The system worked the way we devised it to work . '' </s>
<s> After UNK for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its UNK limit and the second freeze went into effect . </s>
<s> Traders then spent the last half-hour `` watching to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , '' Mr. UNK added , referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour . </s>
<s> One UNK estimated that 80 % to 90 % of the S&P traders `` were just standing around watching . '' </s>
<s> But the UNK circuit breaker never had to kick in , and UNK on the Chicago Board of Trade 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered . </s>
<s> The UNK and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used by program traders to run their computerized trading strategies . </s>
<s> The programs are considered by many to be a major cause of the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> The process of UNK reforms began with calls to UNK the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments . </s>
<s> In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was UNK in talk of sweeping changes in the way the financial markets are structured and regulated . </s>
<s> Over the next year that grand agenda was UNK down to a series of steps to UNK big stock drops by UNK trading to give market players time to UNK and reconsider positions . </s>
<s> In addition , limits were placed on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken to better link the stock and futures markets . </s>
<s> Few changes were made in the way the markets are regulated . </s>
<s> At the UNK the prime target was program trading , which was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill . </s>
<s> There were also calls to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock-index futures and options , which Federal Judge Stanley UNK , for example , UNK to `` UNK attached to the basic market . '' </s>
<s> And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers . </s>
<s> When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released in January 1988 , it immediately UNK the reformers ' agenda . </s>
<s> UNK that the separate financial UNK acted as one , and UNK that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a UNK financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for establishing a UNK to oversee the markets , to make margins consistent across markets , to UNK clearing systems and to install circuit breakers . </s>
<s> Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented . </s>
<s> The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . </s>
<s> In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers . </s>
<s> After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit breakers were set in place , with the most UNK UNK trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> UNK , some free UNK dismissed such UNK as UNK to UNK . </s>
<s> After all , this free-market argument went , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century . </s>
<s> `` Circuit breakers '' set to UNK big drops : </s>
<s> -- If S&P futures fall 5 points at opening , contract trading UNK for 10 minutes . </s>
<s> -- If Dow UNK fall 25 points at opening , contract trading UNK for 10 minutes . </s>
<s> -- If S&P futures fall 12 points ( equivalent to about 100 points on UNK ) , trading is frozen for half hour to that price or higher . </s>
<s> On NYSE program trades are diverted into a separate computer file to determine buy and sell orders . </s>
<s> -- If S&P futures fall 30 points , trading is restricted for an hour to that price or higher . </s>
<s> -- If Dow UNK fall 250 points , trading on the Big Board UNK for an hour . </s>
<s> S&P and UNK contracts also halt . </s>
<s> -- If UNK drops 400 points , Big Board UNK trading for two hours . </s>
<s> Trading in UNK and S&P futures also halted . </s>

<s> Mr. Bebear said UNK Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion of UNK assets that we can and will sell '' to help pay off debt from the acquisition . </s>
<s> He said the assets to be sold would be `` UNK '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers . </s>
<s> `` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said . </s>
<s> The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , UNK has an UNK obligation to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T . </s>
<s> `` We hope that with what we did , the regulators will not need to evaluate UNK , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because UNK wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said . </s>
<s> Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance UNK in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated . </s>
<s> The amended filings were required because of the new agreement between Axa and UNK , and to reflect the extension that Sir James received last month under British takeover rules to complete his proposed acquisition . </s>
<s> UNK dropped its initial # UNK billion ( $ UNK billion ) takeover bid after it received the extension , but said it would launch a new bid if and when the UNK sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval . </s>
<s> A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing UNK has changed . </s>
<s> The new financing structure is still a UNK leveraged one , and Axa still plans to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends to service their debt . '' </s>
<s> That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added . </s>
<s> `` It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders . '' </s>

<s> Though hoping to settle the case , UNK UNK to fight on , if necessary . </s>
<s> But the battle is more than UNK UNK for . </s>
<s> `` I had no idea I was getting in so deep , '' says Mr. UNK , who founded UNK in 1982 . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK had sold UNK Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only to find he was UNK . </s>
<s> With UNK , he began selling UNK and electronics made mostly in Hong Kong , beginning with UNK UNK UNK . </s>
<s> The company has grown -- to about 40 employees , from four initially , Mr. UNK says . </s>
<s> UNK has been profitable since 1986 , adds the official , who shares his office with numerous UNK bears , all samples from his line of UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Like many others , Mr. UNK took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market UNK , changed the plastic skin and UNK on the famous UNK line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children . </s>
<s> The UNK UNK new products looked more like UNK than the adult models . </s>
<s> ( In court papers , Sony says it has spent more than $ 3 million to promote the line , with resulting sales of over a million units . ) </s>
<s> Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. UNK figured that its prices left plenty of room for a UNK competitor . </s>
<s> His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color . </s>
<s> Sony uses mostly red and blue , with UNK of yellow -- and so does UNK , on the theory that kids prefer these colors . </s>
<s> ( `` To be successful , a product can be any color UNK , as long as it is UNK red , '' says Charles E. UNK , UNK 's attorney . ) </s>
<s> By last winter , UNK was showing UNK at toy UNK in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed . </s>
<s> Indeed , concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other UNK -- such as UNK desirable Sony products -- against UNK 's customers , Mr. UNK fired off a letter to Sony in April . </s>
<s> He himself threatened to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department . </s>
<s> But UNK has n't pursued those charges ( which were without merit , according to Mr. UNK , the Sony attorney ) . </s>
<s> UNK Mr. UNK : `` Our purpose was to influence them to leave us alone . </s>

<s> ( UNK claims it began using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children 's market . ) </s>
<s> Whatever its merits , Sony 's aggressive defense is UNK for UNK . </s>

<s> Of Sony , Mr. UNK says : `` They know there 's no way for them to lose . </s>

<s> Of all the one-time expenses incurred by a corporation or professional firm , few are larger or longer term than the purchase of real estate or the signing of a commercial lease . </s>
<s> To take full advantage of the financial opportunities in this commitment , however , the corporation or professional firm must do more than negotiate the best purchase price or lease terms . </s>
<s> It must also evaluate the real-estate market in the chosen location from a new perspective . </s>
<s> UNK , it must understand how real-estate markets UNK to UNK in regional economies and then take advantage of these opportunities . </s>
<s> When a regional economy UNK cold , the local real-estate market gets UNK . </s>
<s> In other words , real-estate market indicators , such as building permits and leasing activity , UNK much further than a local economy in recession . </s>
<s> This was seen in the late 1960s in Los Angeles and the mid-1970s in New York . </s>
<s> But the reverse is also true : When a region 's economy UNK from a slowdown , these real-estate indicators will rebound far faster than the improving economy . </s>
<s> Why do local real-estate markets UNK to regional economic cycles ? </s>
<s> Because real-estate purchases and leases are such major long-term commitments that most companies and individuals make these decisions only when confident of future economic stability and growth . </s>
<s> Metropolitan Detroit was written off economically during the early 1980s , as the domestic auto industry suffered a serious sales depression and adjustment . </s>
<s> Area employment dropped by 13 % from its 1979 peak and retail sales were down 14 % . </s>
<s> However , the real-estate market was hurt even more . </s>
<s> For example , residential building permits in the trough year of 1982 were off 76 % from the 1979 peak level . </s>
<s> Once metropolitan Detroit 's economy rallied in the mid-1980s , real estate rebounded . </s>
<s> Building permits , for example , soared a staggering 400 % between 1982 and the peak year of 1986 . </s>
<s> Where , UNK corporations and professional firms are now asking , are today 's opportunities ? </s>
<s> Look no further than metropolitan Houston and Denver , two of the most depressed , UNK and potentially undervalued real-estate markets in the nation . </s>
<s> Of course , some observers have UNK Houston and Denver for the past five years as a UNK play . </s>
<s> But now appears to be the time to act . </s>
<s> Metropolitan Houston 's economy did drop and then UNK in the years after its 1982 peak . </s>
<s> In the mid-1980s , employment was down as much as 5 % from the 1982 peak and retail sales were off 13 % . </s>
<s> The real-estate market suffered even more severe setbacks . </s>
<s> Office construction dropped 97 % . </s>
<s> The vacancy rate soared more than 20 % in nearly every product category , and more than 30 % of office space was vacant . </s>
<s> To some observers , the empty office buildings of Houston 's `` UNK UNK '' were UNK of a very troubled economy . </s>
<s> As usual , the real-estate market had UNK . </s>
<s> Actually , the region 's economy retained a firm foundation . </s>
<s> Metropolitan Houston 's population has held steady over the past six years . </s>
<s> And personal income , after UNK in the mid-1980s , has returned to its 1982 level in real dollar terms . </s>
<s> Today , metropolitan Houston 's real-estate market is UNK for a significant turnaround . </s>
<s> More than UNK jobs were added in UNK Houston last year , primarily in biotechnology , petrochemical processing , and the computer industry . </s>
<s> This growth puts Houston in the top five UNK areas in the nation last year . </s>
<s> And forecasts project a 2.5 % to 3 % growth rate in jobs over the next few years -- nearly twice the national average . </s>
<s> Denver is another metropolitan area where the commercial real-estate market has UNK to the region 's economic trends , although Denver has not experienced as severe an economic downturn as Houston . </s>
<s> By some measures , metropolitan Denver 's economy has actually improved in the past four years . </s>
<s> Its population has continued to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle . </s>
<s> UNK is now 4 % higher than in 1983 . </s>
<s> Buying income in real dollars actually increased 15 % between 1983 and 1987 ( the most recent year available ) . </s>
<s> The rates of increase , however , are less than the rapid growth of the boom years , and this has resulted in a loss of confidence in the economy . </s>
<s> In a UNK UNK , therefore , the region 's real-estate market all but collapsed in recent years . </s>
<s> Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 UNK . </s>
<s> Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real-estate market will rebound , major public works projects costing several billion dollars are under way or planned -- such as a new convention center , a major UNK UNK the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport . </s>
<s> When Denver 's regional economy begins to grow faster -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will UNK the general economic rebound . </s>
<s> What real-estate strategy should one follow in a metropolitan area whose economic health is not as easy to determine as Houston 's or Denver 's ? </s>
<s> Generally , overcapacity in commercial real estate is dropping from its mid-1980s peak , even in such economically healthy metropolitan areas as Washington , New York and Los Angeles . </s>
<s> UNK rates in the 15 % to 19 % range today may easily rise to the low to UNK % range in a couple of years . </s>
<s> Under these conditions , even a UNK out of economic growth -- `` UNK cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the UNK industry UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Those looking for real-estate bargains in UNK metropolitan areas should lock in leases or buy now ; those looking in healthy metropolitan areas should take a short-term ( three-year ) lease and wait for the bargains ahead . </s>

<s> The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently UNK bonds UNK in price . </s>
<s> So much for UNK the market by a fraction of a second . </s>
<s> And a large UNK of the first episode is devoted to efforts to get rid of some nearly UNK Japanese bonds ( since when is anything Japanese nearly UNK UNK ? ) . </s>

<s> After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money . </s>

<s> Even network executives , however , admit privately that victory -- either in Congress or in talks with the UNK -- is highly UNK any time soon . </s>

<s> An NBC spokesman UNK that Mr. UNK 's UNK was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as to be `` light years away from the type of UNK deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks . '' </s>
<s> The Big Three 's UNK for deregulation began UNK in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans to acquire Warner . </s>
<s> Although Time already had a long-term contract to buy movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely UNK UNK channel , Home UNK Office , own the Warner movies aired on HBO -- a UNK integration that is effectively blocked by UNK regulations . </s>
<s> NBC 's Mr. Wright led the way in UNK the networks ' inability to match a UNK combination . </s>
<s> He spoke up again when the Sony bid for Columbia was announced . </s>
<s> Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM / UA was disclosed , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment . </s>
<s> With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into UNK territory -- possibly raising UNK at the UNK and in Washington . </s>
<s> `` It 's never really been tested , '' says William UNK III , who as a top CBS executive spent years lobbying to have the rules lifted . </s>
<s> He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , consulting to media companies . </s>
<s> UNK rules do n't UNK block a network from buying a passive , small stake in a company that profits from the UNK UNK networks ca n't enjoy . </s>
<s> UNK , NBC might be able to take , say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM / UA . </s>
<s> If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's UNK operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake . </s>
<s> But such UNK would still block the networks from UNK a big chunk of the UNK of UNK . </s>
<s> Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a UNK series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in broadcasting its popular crime / comedy `` UNK '' -- it is n't allowed to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold to local stations . </s>
<s> Instead , ABC will have to sell off the rights for a one-time fee . </s>
<s> The networks admit that the chances of getting the relief they want are UNK -- for several years at the least . </s>
<s> UNK years ago they were UNK close . </s>
<s> The UNK Federal Communications Commission had ruled in favor of killing most of the rules . </s>
<s> UNK evidence , including a UNK Institution study of some 800 series that the networks had aired and had partly owned in the 1960s , showed the networks did n't UNK UNK control over the UNK as had been alleged . </s>

<s> That 's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday 's 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> No one can say for sure what will happen today . </s>
<s> And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months . </s>
<s> But they 're nearly UNK on one point : Do n't sell into a panic . </s>
<s> Investors who sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived to regret it . </s>
<s> Even after Friday 's plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 48 % above where it landed on Oct. 19 two years ago . </s>
<s> UNK selling also was UNK during other big declines in the past . </s>
<s> The crash of 1929 was followed by a substantial recovery before the great UNK and awful bear market of the 1930s began . </s>
<s> The `` October UNK '' of 1978 and 1979 were UNK , but did n't lead to severe or sustained UNK . </s>
<s> Indeed , some pros see Friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain UNK . </s>
<s> `` There has been a lot of emotional selling that presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says Stephen B. UNK , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . </s>
<s> But most advisers think the immediate course for individual investors should be to stand UNK . </s>
<s> `` When you see a UNK train , '' says Steve UNK , partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm UNK & UNK , `` you wait for the train to stop . '' </s>
<s> Even for people who expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market UNK do -- the advice is : UNK for the market to bounce back , and sell shares gradually during rallies . </s>
<s> The best thing individual investors can do is `` just sit tight , '' says Marshall B. UNK , executive vice president and head of investment counseling at Stein Roe & UNK Inc. , a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that manages about $ 18 billion . </s>
<s> On the one hand , Mr. UNK says , it would be UNK to sell into `` a classic panic . '' </s>
<s> On the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time to jump in and buy . </s>
<s> `` This is all UNK right now , and when UNK starts to run , it can run further than anyone anticipates , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` So it 's more prudent to wait and see how things stabilize . '' </s>
<s> Roger UNK , professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm UNK Associates Inc. , says , `` My real advice would be to just ride through it . </s>
<s> Generally , it is n't UNK to be in and out '' of the stock market . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK thinks that this week is `` going to be a UNK week . '' </s>
<s> But he also thinks it is `` a good week to consider buying . '' </s>
<s> John UNK , former president of the Los Angeles chapter of the National Association of Investors Corp. , an organization of investment clubs and individual investors , says his fellow club members did n't sell in the crash of 1987 , and see no reason to sell now . </s>
<s> `` We 're dedicated long-term investors , not traders , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` We understand UNK and UNK . </s>
<s> And we hope to take advantage of UNK and buy stocks when they plunge . '' </s>
<s> One UNK of investment pros sees what happened Friday as an opportunity . </s>
<s> Over the next days and weeks , they say , investors should look for stocks to buy . </s>
<s> Friday 's action `` was an UNK panic , '' says Alfred Goldman , director of technical market analysis for UNK Edwards & Sons in St. Louis . </s>
<s> `` Stocks were being thrown out of windows at any price . '' </s>
<s> His advice : `` You ought to be there with a basket UNK them . '' </s>
<s> James Craig , portfolio manager for the UNK UNK Fund , which has one of the industry 's better track records , started his buying during Friday 's plunge . </s>
<s> Stocks such as UNK Foods Corp. , UNK Stores Inc. , American International Group Inc. and Federal National Mortgage Association became such bargains that he could n't resist them , he says . </s>
<s> And Mr. Craig expects to pick up more shares today . </s>
<s> `` It will be UNK at first , but I would not be buying if I thought we were headed for real trouble , '' he says . </s>
<s> He argues that stocks are reasonably valued now , and that interest rates are lower now than in the fall of 1987 . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK of Stein Roe suggests that any buying should `` concentrate in stocks that have lagged the market on the up side , or stocks that have been UNK down a lot more than the market in this correction . '' </s>
<s> His firm favors selected computer , drug and UNK stocks . </s>
<s> Other investment pros are more pessimistic . </s>
<s> They say investors should sell stocks -- but not necessarily right away . </s>
<s> Many of them stress that the selling can be UNK , gradual , and done when stock prices are UNK . </s>
<s> On Thursday , William UNK , a Seattle money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . </s>
<s> He thinks the underlying inflation rate is around 5 % to 6 % , far higher than most people UNK . </s>
<s> In the pension accounts he manages , Mr. UNK has raised cash positions and invested in gold and natural gas stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . </s>
<s> He thinks government officials are UNK to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high . </s>
<s> So he thinks the government will UNK on the side of UNK inflation . </s>
<s> As a result , Mr. UNK says , `` I think the ball game 's over , '' and investors are about to face a bear market . </s>
<s> David M. Jones , vice president at UNK G. UNK & Co. , recommends Treasury securities ( of up to five years ' maturity ) . </s>
<s> He says the Oct. 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors . </s>
<s> One strategy for investors who want to stay in but hedge their UNK is to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual stocks they own or on a broad market index . </s>
<s> A put option gives its holder the right ( but not the obligation ) to sell a stock ( or stock index ) for a specified price ( the strike price ) until the option expires . </s>
<s> Whether this insurance is UNK depends on the cost of an option . </s>
<s> The cost , or premium , tends to get fat in times of crisis . </s>
<s> Thus , buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way to hedge against risk . </s>
<s> The prices of puts generally did n't soar Friday . </s>
<s> For example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on Eli Lilly & Co. moved up from 3 % at Thursday 's close to only 3.3 % at Friday 's close , even though the shares dropped more than $ UNK . </s>
<s> But UNK prices may UNK when trading UNK today . </s>
<s> It 's hard to UNK about a reasonable price for puts . </s>
<s> But investors should keep in mind , before paying too much , that the average annual return for stock holdings , long-term , is 9 % to 10 % a year ; a return of 15 % is considered UNK . </s>
<s> UNK , say , 10 % for insurance against losses takes a deep UNK out of the return . </s>

<s> Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday . </s>
<s> After 26 years in prison , Mr. Sisulu , the UNK former UNK of the UNK movement , was dropped off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up . </s>

<s> As the crowd outside his home UNK `` ANC , ANC , '' the old man shot his UNK into the air . </s>
<s> `` I 'm inspired by the mood of the people . '' </s>
<s> Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in UNK , UNK . </s>
<s> But the UNK release of the seven leaders , who once formed the intellectual and UNK core of the ANC , is a de UNK UNK of the movement and the UNK of its internal UNK . </s>
<s> `` The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , '' said UNK UNK , a veteran UNK activist on hand to welcome Mr. Sisulu . </s>
<s> `` UNK have gone too far for the government to stop them now . </s>
<s> There 's no turning back . '' </s>
<s> There was certainly no UNK the UNK of ANC UNK last night , when hundreds of people UNK into the UNK Cross UNK Church in UNK for what became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years . </s>

<s> And they called on the government to release Nelson UNK , the ANC 's leading figure , who was jailed with them and remains in prison . </s>
<s> Without him , said Mr. Sisulu , the UNK of the others `` is only a UNK . '' </s>
<s> President UNK de UNK released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan UNK Congress , a rival UNK group -- as part of his efforts to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new UNK aimed at giving blacks a voice in national government . </s>
<s> But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this UNK divided country . </s>
<s> As other UNK governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that becomes difficult , if not impossible , to control . </s>
<s> As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed to justify the continued UNK of Mr. UNK as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency . </s>
<s> If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised by yesterday 's releases will turn to UNK and unrest . </s>
<s> If it does , the large number of UNK whites , who oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their UNK and threats to take matters into their own hands . </s>
<s> The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure . </s>
<s> The government is watching closely to see if their presence in the UNK leads to increased UNK protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason to keep Mr. UNK behind bars . </s>
<s> Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life UNK in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to UNK the government . </s>
<s> In addition , the government is UNK that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly UNK leaders and those activists who have emerged as leaders inside the country during their UNK . </s>
<s> In order to head off any divisions , Mr. UNK , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released , UNK them to report to the ANC headquarters in UNK as soon as possible . </s>
<s> The men also will be faced with UNK the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many UNK black UNK , the so-called young UNK who are anxious to see the old UNK in action . </s>
<s> Says Peter UNK , president of the South African UNK Congress : `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC . '' </s>
<s> They never considered themselves to be anything else . </s>
<s> At last night 's rally , they called on their UNK to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid . </s>
<s> `` We UNK discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said Andrew UNK , another early UNK leader who is now 63 . </s>
<s> `` We want to see Nelson UNK and all our UNK out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined we may not see them here with us . </s>
<s> UNK for UNK `` national service , '' like UNK , UNK up from time to time , UNK the resistance of the body UNK , run their course , and seem to disappear , only to UNK and UNK public life UNK . </s>
<s> The disease UNK comes to mind , of course , not as an UNK on the advocates of national service . </s>
<s> Rather , it is born of frustration with having to combat constantly changing UNK of a UNK idea that one thought had been eliminated in the early 1970s , along with UNK . </s>
<s> It is back with us again , in the form of legislation to pay UNK under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall . </s>
<s> Why does the UNK virus keep coming back ? </s>
<s> Perhaps it is because UNK UNK UNK both military experience and the social UNK . </s>
<s> If only we could get America 's UNK youth into at least a UNK uniform we might be able to teach UNK again and revive the spirit of giving . </s>
<s> A quarter of a century ago national service was UNK as a way of UNK the UNK UNK of the draft -- by , of all things , expanding the draft . </s>
<s> Those of us who resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many UNK backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no UNK . </s>
<s> UNK of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed to UNK national service as much as the draft . </s>
<s> But the virus was kept alive in UNK departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let loose . </s>
<s> This time it attempted to UNK two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans . </s>
<s> Why not keep and even expand the loans and grants , the advocates UNK , but require some form of service from each UNK ? </s>
<s> UNK service , UNK , could be a UNK option . </s>
<s> Thus , UNK it was hoped that the new strain of national service would prove UNK , UNK UNK conservatives , UNK UNK , and UNK liberals . </s>
<s> The Democratic UNK Council , a UNK group UNK the plan , surely thought it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents . </s>
<s> A provision allowing grants to be applied to UNK purchases was added to appeal to those who had had enough of UNK . </s>
<s> The UNK plan UNK `` UNK '' UNK trees , UNK UNK , UNK children , and UNK UNK for $ 100 a week , tax free , plus medical care . </s>
<s> With a tax-free $ 10,000 UNK payment at the end of each year , the UNK would be making a wage comparable to $ UNK a year . </s>
<s> UNK you , most of `` the UNK '' would be UNK 17 - to UNK , some not even high school UNK , and many saving money by living at home . </s>
<s> They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families . </s>
<s> As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that count on the present education grant system , so the UNK UNK decided to abandon the UNK crucial principle of `` give in order to get . '' </s>
<s> UNK to national service from the Pentagon , which wants to protect its own UNK process , also led to the UNK option being dropped . </s>
<s> Clearly , a new UNK for national service had to be UNK up . </s>
<s> What better place to turn than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great UNK of government UNK , where many a UNK UNK of UNK is kept on the back UNK until it can be brought forward and presented as UNK UNK ? </s>
<s> In this case , the new UNK for national service called for throwing many UNK legislative UNK into one UNK : a demonstration project for educational aid ( particularly UNK to the UNK and Sen. Sam UNK ) , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation ( a la Sen. Chris UNK ) , a competitive grants program to states to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects ( a Kennedy specialty ) , a community service UNK program for students ( UNK to the UNK of Sen. Dale UNK , among others ) , plus UNK of the UNK volunteer program and the UNK UNK UNK , Foster UNK , and UNK UNK programs . </s>
<s> Before the UNK is printed , the House may add more UNK , also changing the initial price , now posted at some $ UNK million . </s>

<s> The UNK of UNK is in the air . </s>
<s> Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ? </s>
<s> On the contrary , it is as robust as ever . </s>
<s> According to the UNK UNK , American adults contribute an average of two hours a week of service , while financial contributions to charity in the 1980s have risen 30 % ( adjusted for inflation ) . </s>
<s> Even if government does see various `` UNK needs , '' national service is not the way to meet them . </s>
<s> If we want to support students , we might adopt the idea used in other countries of offering more UNK based on something called `` UNK , '' rather than on the government 's idea of `` service . '' </s>
<s> Or we might provide a tax credit for working students . </s>
<s> What we do not need to do is start a war , and then try to justify it by creating a UNK Bill . </s>
<s> To the extent we lack UNK to staff UNK jobs in hospitals , for example , we should raise pay , pursue UNK technology , or allow more legal UNK , rather than UNK high school UNK as short-term workers and cause UNK among permanent workers paid lesser amounts to do the same jobs . </s>
<s> Will national service , in the current highly UNK and UNK form UNK enough appeal to get adopted ? </s>
<s> Not necessarily . </s>
<s> UNK show wide , UNK support for some vague concept of service , but the bill now under discussion lacks any UNK public backing . </s>
<s> Nonetheless , Senate Democrats are organizing a roll of supporting `` associations , '' `` UNK '' and `` UNK , '' some of which may hope to receive the paid `` UNK . '' </s>
<s> So far , the president seems UNK to substitute any of the omnibus for his own UNK proposal to UNK a `` UNK of UNK '' foundation with $ 25 million to inform citizens of all UNK and UNK them to genuine UNK . </s>
<s> However , even this UNK plan could become UNK if the White House gives in to congressional Democratic pressure to add to the scope of the president 's initiative or to involve the independent foundation in `` UNK '' federal funds for volunteer projects . </s>

<s> Mr. UNK is a fellow at the UNK Hudson Institute . </s>
<s> This article is adapted from remarks at a UNK Institution conference on national service , in which Mr. UNK also participated . </s>
<s> The debate over National Service has begun again . </s>
<s> After a decade in which more than 50 UNK established their own service or conservation UNK and dozens of school systems made community service a UNK to high-school UNK , the focus has UNK to Washington . </s>
<s> At least 10 bills proposing one or another national program were introduced in Congress this spring . </s>
<s> One , UNK by Sen. Sam UNK ( D. , UNK . ) and Rep. Dave UNK ( D. , UNK ) , would have restricted federal college subsidies to students who had served . </s>
<s> An omnibus bill assembled by Sen. Edward Kennedy ( D. , Mass. ) , and including some diluted UNK provisions along with proposals by fellow Democratic UNK UNK UNK , Barbara UNK and Christopher UNK , has been reported out of the Senate Labor Committee . </s>
<s> It might well win Senate passage . </s>
<s> President Bush has UNK his own UNK UNK Service ( UNK ) plan , though its details remain to be specified . </s>
<s> What is one to think of all this ? </s>
<s> UNK and special interests govern some responses . </s>
<s> People eager to have youth `` pay their UNK to society '' favor service proposals -- UNK mandatory ones . </s>
<s> So do those who seek a `` UNK concept of UNK , '' a concept imposing UNK obligations as well as UNK rights . </s>
<s> Then there are UNK opponents . </s>
<s> To UNK , mandatory service is an UNK and voluntary systems are UNK uses of tax money . </s>
<s> UNK of the market question the value of the work national service would perform : </s>
<s> If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost . </s>
<s> UNK of the left are also UNK opposed ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the UNK of youth , or want to see rights UNK , not obligations . </s>
<s> But what about those of us whose views are not UNK by formula or UNK ? </s>
<s> How should we think about national service ? </s>
<s> Let 's begin by recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning . </s>
<s> UNK service be voluntary or UNK ? </s>
<s> Short or long ? </s>
<s> UNK or full-time ? </s>
<s> UNK or unpaid ? </s>
<s> UNK participants live at home and work nearby or live in UNK and work on public UNK ? </s>
<s> What kinds of work would they do ? </s>
<s> What does `` national '' mean ? </s>
<s> UNK the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ? </s>
<s> And who would serve ? </s>
<s> Only males , as with the draft , or both UNK ? </s>
<s> UNK only or all UNK ? </s>
<s> UNK people , or poor people , or a genuine UNK ? </s>
<s> Many or few ? </s>
<s> Those are not UNK questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them . </s>
<s> Then how should we think about national service ? </s>
<s> As a starting point , here are five UNK : 1 . Consider the UNK , not the name . </s>
<s> UNK `` national service '' in the UNK ; consider specific proposals . </s>
<s> They will differ in crucial ways . </s>
<s> 2 . `` Service '' should be service . </s>
<s> As commonly understood , service implies sacrifice . </s>
<s> It involves accepting risk , or giving up income , or deferring a career . </s>
<s> It follows that proposals like UNK , whose benefits to UNK are worth some $ UNK a year , do not qualify . </s>
<s> There is a UNK for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a UNK Bill without the UNK '' ; UNK those benefits should be earned , not given . </s>
<s> But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school UNK with full-time jobs . </s>
<s> Why call that service ? </s>
<s> 3 . UNK is fine ; UNK is not . </s>
<s> UNK service is unconstitutional . </s>
<s> It is also UNK and UNK . </s>
<s> ( Who will throw several hundred thousand UNK in jail each year ? ) </s>
<s> But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government UNK many kinds of behavior . </s>
<s> It should also encourage service -- UNK by all classes and all UNK . </s>
<s> Its encouragement should strengthen and not undercut the strong tradition of UNK in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local UNK about which tasks most need doing . </s>
<s> 4 . Good programs are not cheap . </s>
<s> UNK assume that national service would get important work done UNK : forest fires fought , housing UNK , students UNK , UNK centers UNK . </s>
<s> There is important work to be done , and existing service and conservation UNK have shown that even UNK who start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not UNK . </s>
<s> Good service programs require UNK , UNK , training and UNK -- all of high quality . </s>
<s> They involve UNK to participants . </s>
<s> UNK residential programs also require housing and full-time UNK ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale . </s>
<s> UNK programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 a year . </s>
<s> Are they worth that ? </s>
<s> UNK suggest that good ones are -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted . </s>
<s> But the calculations are UNK . </s>
<s> 5 . UNK youth are a special concern . </s>
<s> Are such expenditures UNK , then ? </s>
<s> Yes , if targeted . </s>
<s> People of all UNK and all classes should be encouraged to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their UNK , to serve at little public cost . </s>
<s> They can volunteer at any of thousands of UNK institutions , or participate in service programs required by high schools or encouraged by colleges or employers . </s>
<s> UNK youth do n't have those opportunities . </s>
<s> They are not UNK in high school or college . </s>
<s> They are unlikely to be employed . </s>
<s> And they have grown up in UNK grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , UNK by UNK UNK and bleak prospects . </s>
<s> But many of them can be quite UNK UNK by UNK and disciplined service . </s>
<s> Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons . </s>
<s> But some whom nothing else is reaching are UNK . </s>
<s> Learning skills , producing something UNK , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them . </s>
<s> Even if it is cheaper to build UNK or UNK apartments or plant UNK with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the UNK . </s>
<s> UNK speaking , these youth are not performing service . </s>
<s> They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , UNK no risk . </s>
<s> But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin to respect themselves ( and others ) , to take control of their lives , to think of the future . </s>
<s> That is a service to the nation . </s>
<s> It is what federal support should try hardest to achieve . </s>

<s> The state agency said the latest revision left the growth rate for the first-quarter compared with the previous three months unchanged at 1.3 % . </s>
<s> If the economy continues to expand by UNK % a quarter for the rest of the year , it would leave UNK growth for all of 1989 at 3 % , the institute said . </s>

<s> `` It 's disappointing , '' said William UNK , an analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co . </s>
<s> Much of the earnings decline was led by UNK rate adjustments , which affected the bottom line by $ UNK million , or 17 cents a share , compared with $ 3.6 million , or four cents a share , the previous year . </s>
<s> UNK prices for aluminum UNK and certain UNK products and a shift in the product mix also contributed to lower earnings , the company said . </s>
<s> `` In addition , costs were higher partly due to scheduled plant UNK for UNK work , '' the company said . </s>

<s> Greece 's second UNK of general elections this year is slated for Nov. 5 . </s>
<s> For those hoping to see a UNK of political UNK restored -- in view of Greece 's UNK UNK under UNK UNK and subsequent three-month UNK with a UNK coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still UNK former Prime Minister UNK UNK and his fallen socialist government are like UNK UNK around a UNK UNK . </s>
<s> In the UNK round of voting , UNK gave no clear mandate to any single political party . </s>
<s> The ad interim coalition government that emerged from UNK UNK was , in UNK , little more than the UNK UNK of ideological UNK : On one side , the UNK New UNK Party , headed by UNK UNK . </s>
<s> On the other , the so-called UNK of the UNK and UNK -- a UNK and rather deceptive title for a merger of the UNK Communist Party of Greece and its UNK UNK , the UNK UNK . </s>
<s> The UNK bond for this UNK UNK was plain : UNK ( Mr. UNK 's party ) as common political enemy . </s>
<s> The UNK goal was a UNK of government corruption , UNK at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. UNK and his UNK associates . </s>
<s> In point of fact , this UNK was overdue by decades . </s>
<s> When reduced to UNK status in UNK UNK UNK , however , the notion UNK into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice . </s>
<s> With regard to Greece 's UNK UNK scandal , Mr. UNK 's principal UNK remains George UNK , former owner of the Bank of UNK and UNK UNK , now UNK in a jail cell in UNK , Mass. , from where he is fighting UNK proceedings that would return him to Greece . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK 's credibility is , at best , UNK . </s>
<s> He has ample UNK to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found less than UNK on numerous points . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the New UNK and Communist parties UNK his UNK as proof of UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Among UNK questions are whether Mr. UNK received $ 23 million of stolen Bank of UNK funds and an additional $ UNK in UNK , as contended ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies to deposit some $ 57 million in Mr. UNK 's bank and then UNK off the interest ; and , what UNK 's cut was from the $ UNK million Mr. UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Two former ministers were so heavily UNK in the UNK affair that UNK members of Parliament voted to refer them to the special court . </s>
<s> But UNK parliamentary probe was the case of millions of UNK Mr. UNK UNK into New UNK UNK . </s>
<s> In the end , the investigation produced only UNK evidence and `` indications '' that point to UNK , not UNK proof . </s>
<s> On another issue , UNK were told how their national intelligence agency , the UNK , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and UNK cabinet members . </s>
<s> Despite convincing arguments , it was never established that Mr. UNK personally ordered or directed the UNK . </s>
<s> The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and UNK . </s>
<s> The coalition government tried to show that UNK ministers had received hefty sums for UNK the purchase of UNK UNK Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced by the UNK General Dynamics Corp. and France 's UNK UNK UNK , respectively . </s>
<s> UNK , neither General Dynamics nor UNK could be expected to UNK its prospective future dealings by making disclosures of sums paid ( or not ) to various UNK officials for services UNK . </s>
<s> So it seems that Mr. UNK and his communist UNK may have UNK served Mr. UNK a moral victory on a UNK : UNK , whether guilty or not , can now UNK the UNK UNK the whole affair as a UNK UNK at Mr. UNK 's expense . </s>
<s> But while UNK high UNK alone wo n't help UNK regain power , Mr. UNK should never be UNK . </s>
<s> First came his predictable UNK : He charged the UNK of the UNK and UNK had sold out its leftist UNK by UNK in a UNK plot aimed at UNK UNK and UNK the course of socialism in Greece . </s>
<s> Then , to UNK his credibility with the left , he UNK some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Next , he continued to court the UNK -- many of whom feel UNK by the UNK coalition 's birth -- by bringing into UNK a UNK Communist Party candidate . </s>
<s> For balance , and in hopes of gaining some UNK UNK votes , he managed to attract a former New UNK Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> Thus UNK heads for the polls not only with diminished UNK , but also with `` UNK of approval '' from representatives of its UNK UNK . </s>
<s> UNK as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the UNK . </s>
<s> The country 's future NATO participation remains UNK , for instance . </s>
<s> Greece also must UNK major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation . </s>
<s> Greece 's UNK relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well . </s>
<s> For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece UNK in May 1990 . </s>
<s> UNK for a new agreement were frozen before the June elections , but the UNK is running . </s>
<s> Another matter of concern is the UNK of UNK UNK , a Palestinian UNK who is wanted in the U.S. for the 1982 UNK of a Pan American Airways flight . </s>
<s> The UNK courts have decided in favor of UNK in the UNK case , but the matter UNK final approval from Greece 's next justice minister . </s>
<s> The UNK seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a UNK test of whether Greece will be counted in or out for international efforts to combat terrorism . </s>
<s> That UNK could win the elections outright is UNK ; the UNK press , previously eager to UNK off UNK 's line , has turned on Mr. UNK with a UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Yet the possibility of another UNK government is all too real . </s>
<s> If Mr. UNK becomes the major opposition leader , he could UNK a UNK coalition . </s>
<s> Also , he could force new elections early next year by UNK the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March . </s>
<s> New UNK has once again UNK UNK the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against UNK , UNK to tend to either program UNK or the UNK of internal UNK . </s>
<s> As for Mr. UNK ? </s>
<s> He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage . </s>
<s> But since he is UNK one of the most UNK bull UNK who ever UNK UNK , it seems far UNK to view him as UNK , but certainly not yet eliminated . </s>

<s> The Bush administration , urging the Supreme Court to give states more UNK to restrict abortions , said UNK have n't any right to abortion without the consent of their parents . </s>

<s> He also argued that the high court was wrong in 1976 to rule that UNK have a right to abortion that ca n't be absolutely vetoed by their parents . </s>
<s> The administration 's position was UNK in a UNK brief filed in one of three abortion cases the Supreme Court will hear argued and will decide this term . </s>
<s> The administration filed the brief in an appeal involving a Minnesota law that requires that both parents of a minor be notified before she may have an abortion . </s>
<s> The administration urged the UNK to adopt a legal standard suggested by Chief Justice William UNK last July when the high court upheld Missouri 's abortion restrictions . </s>
<s> Under that standard , which UNK the votes of only three of the nine UNK , a state restriction of abortion is constitutional if the state has a `` reasonable '' UNK for adopting it . </s>
<s> That is a much easier standard for a state to satisfy than the Supreme Court 's test since 1973 , which requires a state to have a `` UNK '' reason for UNK abortion . </s>
<s> On the provisions of the Minnesota law , the Bush administration said that requiring that both parents be notified is a reasonable regulation , and that there is no need to have an alternative that allows UNK to go to court for a judge 's permission instead . </s>

<s> Although the manufacturers stress that production has n't been affected by China 's political turmoil , they are looking for additional sites . </s>
<s> The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies . </s>
<s> `` Nobody wants to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says David UNK , chairman and chief executive officer of International UNK Group Ltd . </s>
<s> Indeed , UNK and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the massacre . </s>
<s> Their steps were partly prompted by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China . </s>
<s> By diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers say . </s>
<s> It would n't be easy to UNK quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade . </s>
<s> A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's UNK province a premier manufacturing site . </s>
<s> `` South China is the most competitive source of UNK in the world , '' says Henry UNK , executive director of UNK UNK UNK Consolidated Ltd . </s>
<s> Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border . </s>
<s> In 1988 , exports of UNK produced UNK and games fell 19 % from 1987 , to HK$ UNK billion ( US$ 1.29 billion ) . </s>
<s> But UNK , mainly from China , jumped 75 % , to HK$ UNK billion . </s>
<s> In 1989 's first seven months , domestic exports fell 29 % , to HK$ UNK billion , while UNK rose 56 % , to HK$ UNK billion . </s>
<s> Manufacturers say there is no immediate substitute for southern China , where an estimated UNK people are employed by the toy industry . </s>
<s> `` For the next few years , like it or not , China is going to be the main supplier , '' says UNK Young , vice president of UNK Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers to move across the border . </s>
<s> In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia . </s>
<s> Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including UNK , UNK UNK and UNK Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed by Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied . </s>
<s> With the European Community set to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites . </s>
<s> UNK about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , UNK of UNK Inc. and UNK Industries Inc . </s>
<s> Hong Kong manufacturers say large debt UNK and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties UNK the local industry , causing it to UNK credit policies and financial management . </s>
<s> The industry UNK last year and this year as a period of recovery that will lead to improved results . </s>

<s> Should sales continue to be strong through the Christmas season , which accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. UNK said the UNK UNK could make 1989 a record sales year for UNK . </s>
<s> Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 . </s>
<s> Besides the lack of a UNK product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by UNK Entertainment System , an expensive video game made by UNK Co. of Japan . </s>
<s> UNK buyers have little money left to spend on other products . </s>

<s> Also , concern exists that the UNK Beijing leadership will UNK its control of UNK , which has been the main laboratory for the UNK policy and economic reforms . </s>
<s> But , toy manufacturers and other UNK say Beijing will be UNK from UNK controls on UNK southern China . </s>
<s> They say China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short of foreign exchange for it to UNK production in UNK . </s>

<s> The UNK among takeover stocks Friday does n't mean the end of UNK but simply marks the start of a less ambitious game , Wall Street 's big-time deal makers say . </s>

<s> This is an UNK sign for a stock market that lately has been fueled by takeover speculation and bidding wars for companies that put themselves up for sale . </s>

<s> Trading UNK up Friday in the market for high-yield junk bonds , often used to finance takeovers . </s>
<s> It was the latest in a series of setbacks for the junk bond market , where prices began weakening last month after Campeau hit a cash crunch . </s>
<s> And banks appear to be taking an increasingly skeptical view of requests for high-risk takeover loans . </s>
<s> The group trying to buy UAL announced Friday that it could n't arrange the $ 7.2 billion in bank loans it needs to buy the parent of United Airlines for $ 300 a share . </s>
<s> UNK traders today will be scrambling to learn of any UAL developments , and other takeover stocks are likely to trade in UNK . </s>
<s> Investment bankers representing the buy-out group and UAL 's board spent a UNK weekend trying to UNK out new terms that would be more acceptable to the banks . </s>
<s> After UAL , the stock viewed as most vulnerable is American Airlines ' parent AMR , the target of a $ UNK takeover proposal from New York real estate developer Donald Trump . </s>
<s> Trading in AMR shares was suspended shortly after 3 p.m. EDT Friday and did n't resume . </s>
<s> Before the halt , AMR last traded at 98 5\/8 . </s>

<s> Similarly , Delta Air Lines and USAir Group dropped 10.1 % and 8.5 % , respectively , on Friday and could weaken further . </s>
<s> Over the UNK , however , two developments in other deals indicated that UNK banks and Wall Street firms still are willing to commit billions of dollars to finance takeover bids launched by major companies . </s>
<s> UNK S.A. , a major Mexican glass maker , said yesterday that it agreed to buy UNK UNK Container in a tender offer for $ UNK a share , sweetened from the original $ UNK offer UNK launched two months ago . </s>
<s> On Friday , UNK shares fell 1 1\/4 to close at 18 1\/2 . </s>
<s> For the broader market , the greatest significance of the UNK deal may be that it was put together late Friday night -- after the market UNK -- and involves a $ 155 million temporary `` bridge '' loan from Donaldson , Lufkin & Jenrette Securities and a $ UNK million loan from Security Pacific National Bank . </s>
<s> Moreover , to complete the entire UNK UNK purchase and UNK existing debt , Donaldson said it is `` highly confident '' that it will be able to sell $ 400 million of junk bonds for UNK , despite the current disarray in the junk bond market . </s>
<s> Donaldson 's statement is n't merely an idle UNK , because those bonds will have to be sold before Donaldson 's bridge loan can be paid back . </s>
<s> Security Pacific , meanwhile , said it expects to arrange $ UNK million in bank loans for UNK . </s>
<s> In another takeover battle , a spokesman for McCaw Cellular Communications said yesterday that McCaw has been advised by three commercial banks that they remain `` highly confident '' they can arrange $ 4.5 billion of bank loans for McCaw 's tender offer for about 45 % of LIN Broadcasting , `` notwithstanding recent events . '' </s>
<s> McCaw is offering $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares , thereby challenging LIN 's proposal to spin off its television properties , pay shareholders a $ UNK special dividend and combine its UNK operations with BellSouth 's cellular business . </s>
<s> On Friday , LIN shares were among the few takeover issues that did n't fall much , dropping 5 1\/2 , or 4.9 % , to close at 107 1\/2 . </s>
<s> Traders and investment bankers said LIN shares were n't hurt much because BellSouth is viewed as a UNK corporate buyer unlikely to be affected by UNK among bankers or bond buyers . </s>

<s> `` In the past , corporate buyers were often UNK from making bids because of competition from LBO firms , which were often prepared to UNK '' the corporations , says J. UNK Hill , head of mergers and acquisitions at Shearson Lehman Hutton . </s>
<s> Now , `` corporate buyers should be willing to UNK the acquisition market because the competition from UNK buyers has been reduced . '' </s>
<s> Many takeover stocks plunged Friday , as speculators retained their confidence in corporate buyers but fled from the UNK UNK stocks , the targets of rumored deals . </s>
<s> Columbia Pictures Entertainment , which has agreed to a friendly $ UNK bid from Sony of Japan , fell only 1\/8 to close at 26 5\/8 . </s>
<s> But several stocks long rumored to be UNK for a takeover or restructuring fell 10 % or more . </s>

<s> The market -- and investment bankers -- are even less UNK about companies that have had at least one bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already . </s>
<s> Given the weakness in both the junk bond market and the stock market , traders fear that these transactions may be revised yet again . </s>
<s> UNK include UNK , whose agreement to be acquired for $ 25 a share by UNK collapsed last month . </s>
<s> UNK shares fell nearly 20 % on Friday to close at 12 7\/8 . </s>
<s> Ramada , which first delayed and then UNK a $ 400 million junk bond sale that was designed to help finance a restructuring , fell 15.6 % to close at 9 1\/2 . </s>

<s> Shares of American Medical International , which agreed last week to accept a lower price from a buy-out group that includes First Boston Corp. and the UNK family of Chicago , fell UNK % on Friday to close at 20 . </s>
<s> The buy-out group is offering $ UNK a share for 63 million American Medical shares , down from its offer in July of $ 28 a share for UNK million shares . </s>
<s> But investment bankers say the market may have UNK some UNK stocks . </s>
<s> UNK UNK , for example , was among the UNK issues , falling UNK % to close at 85 , down 21 1\/2 on Friday . </s>
<s> UNK currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses . </s>
<s> People familiar with UNK said over the weekend that the UNK of the sell-off in UNK shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing . </s>
<s> However , they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group UNK a general UNK among banks to provide credit for UNK takeovers . </s>
<s> UNK officials said they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock . </s>
<s> William UNK , UNK 's general counsel , said plans to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what has been described previously as `` a slow and UNK process . '' </s>
<s> `` I ca n't believe that any potential buyer for UNK would be affected by one day 's trading , '' Mr. UNK said . </s>
<s> But the stock market as a whole , bolstered as it is by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further UNK by takeover financiers , both in the UNK market and among commercial banks . </s>

<s> UNK , they watched brokerage houses mark down price quotations on their junk holdings while being able to execute very few actual trades . </s>
<s> `` The junk bond market is in a state of gridlock now -- there are no bids , only offers , '' says independent investor Martin D. UNK , who manages nearly $ 4 billion and who recently decided to buy UNK securities for a new fund . </s>
<s> This UNK is `` far from over , '' he says . </s>
<s> UNK 's collapse helped UNK the UNK selling of stocks that produced the UNK one-day dive in the Dow Jones Industrial Average since the Oct. 19 , 1987 , crash . </s>
<s> UNK , it also helped trigger this year 's biggest rally in the U.S. government bond market as investors rushed to move capital into the UNK securities they could find . </s>
<s> But `` an UNK UNK UNK '' the junk market Friday as prices tumbled on hundreds of high-yield bonds despite `` no active trading , '' says John UNK , an economist at Moody 's Investors Service Inc . </s>
<s> For example , the price of UNK Corp. 's $ 500 million of 16 3\/4 % bonds due UNK -- sold less than two years ago by Goldman , Sachs & Co. -- plummeted 25 % to just 30 cents on the dollar . </s>
<s> But not even Goldman would make a market in the securities of UNK , the owner of the nationwide chain of UNK convenience stores that is strapped for cash . </s>
<s> Goldman officials declined to comment . </s>
<s> UNK bonds , which UNK from less than $ 2 billion at the start of this decade , have been declining for months as issuer after issuer sank beneath the weight of hefty interest payments . </s>
<s> The shaky market received its biggest jolt last month from Campeau Corp. , which created its U.S. retailing empire with junk financing . </s>
<s> Campeau developed a cash squeeze that caused it to be UNK on some interest payments and to put its prestigious UNK department-store chain up for sale . </s>
<s> Now , dozens of corporations , including UNK Allen , TW Services and York International , that are counting on at least $ 7 billion of scheduled new junk financings to keep their highly leveraged takeovers and buy-outs UNK , may never get the money . </s>
<s> `` The music has stopped playing , '' says Michael UNK , a principal in the investment firm of Levy UNK . </s>
<s> `` You 've either got a chair or you do n't . '' </s>
<s> In Friday 's aftermath , says R. Douglas UNK , a director of high-yield finance at First Boston Corp. , `` much of the $ 7 billion forward calendar could be UNK , depending on the UNK . '' </s>
<s> In August , First Boston withdrew a $ 475 million junk offering of Ohio UNK bonds because potential buyers were `` very UNK . '' </s>
<s> The outlook `` looks shaky because we 're still waiting '' for mutual funds , in particular , to dump some of their junk bond holdings to pay off UNK by individual investors , says King UNK , senior vice president at UNK , UNK & UNK , an investment arm of Xerox Financial Services . </s>
<s> Indeed , a Moody 's index that tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the UNK consecutive day Friday . </s>
<s> In a UNK contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 for each $ 1,000 face amount , to 103 UNK , its biggest gain of the year . </s>
<s> The bond 's yield dropped to UNK % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to UNK Data Global Markets Group . </s>
<s> The yield on three-month Treasury bills , considered the UNK of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to UNK % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 . </s>
<s> The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the UNK drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> `` When you get panic in one market , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said Maria UNK , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead . </s>
<s> `` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says William Sullivan , director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , New York . </s>
<s> Any sustained UNK could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities . </s>
<s> Robert Dow , a partner and portfolio manager at Lord , UNK & Co. , which manages $ 4 billion of high-yield bonds , says he does n't `` think there is any fundamental economic UNK { for the junk bond UNK } . </s>
<s> It was UNK UNK . '' </s>
<s> He adds : `` The junk market has UNK some trouble and now some people think that if the equity market gets UNK that means the economy will be terrible and that 's bad for junk . </s>
<s> I do n't believe that 's the case , but I believe that people are running scared . </s>
<s> There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . '' </s>
<s> Even as trading in high-yield issues UNK up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion of new junk bonds . </s>
<s> For example , a recent $ UNK million offering of UNK Gas Services UNK bonds sold by First Boston was three times oversubscribed . </s>
<s> A $ 550 million offering of Turner Broadcasting System Inc . high-yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased $ 50 million because of strong demand . </s>
<s> First Boston estimates that in November and December alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion of coupon interest payments . </s>
<s> `` That 's a clear indication that there is and will be an UNK of basic business going on , '' says Mr. UNK of First Boston . </s>
<s> `` I do n't know how people can say the junk bond market UNK when there were $ 1.5 billion of orders for $ 550 million of junk bonds sold last week by Turner , '' says Raymond UNK , UNK of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co . </s>
<s> `` When the rally comes , insurance companies will be leading it because they have billions to invest and invest they will . </s>
<s> There is plenty of money available from people who want to buy UNK deals ; it 's the stuff that 's financed on a UNK that people are wary of . '' </s>
<s> But such highly leveraged transactions seemed to have UNK this year , casting a UNK over much of the junk market . </s>
<s> Michael UNK , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services , says the quality of junk issues has been getting UNK , contributing to the slide in prices . </s>
<s> `` Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six . </s>
<s> And our credit standards have n't changed one UNK . '' </s>
<s> However , Mr. UNK said the slide in junk is creating `` one UNK of a buying opportunity '' for UNK buyers . </s>
<s> For the moment , investors seem more UNK with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . </s>
<s> `` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , says Mr. UNK of Merrill Lynch . </s>
<s> `` That really affected the market in that people started to ask ` What else is in trouble ? ' '' </s>
<s> Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was UNK through one of its worst years ever . </s>
<s> Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , UNK by a seemingly UNK trail of bad news : </s>
<s> -- In June , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion of speculative debt securities , New York-based Integrated Resources Inc. said it ran out of borrowed money . </s>
<s> -- In July , UNK Corp. , the UNK real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law . </s>
<s> -- By the end of July , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points . </s>
<s> -- In August , UNK International Inc. , which sold more than $ 500 million of junk bonds , suspended interest payments . </s>
<s> -- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , UNK Financial Corp. UNK on $ 145 million of notes and appeared unlikely to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion of debt securities . </s>
<s> UNK , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of UNK . </s>
<s> Moody 's says the UNK of corporate credit UNK is the highest this year since 1982 . </s>
<s> In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . </s>
<s> `` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest UNK UNK , an early critic of the junk bond market . </s>
<s> `` What we 've begun to see is the damage to businesses of paying UNK compound interest . </s>
<s> UNK were borrowing at interest rates higher than their own earnings . </s>
<s> What we 're seeing now is the UNK UNK of asset values to a future when UNK debt will be hard to obtain rather than easy . '' </s>
<s> Friday 's Market Activity </s>
<s> Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a UNK stock market . </s>
<s> The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted 6 p.m. EDT at 103 UNK , compared with 100 UNK Thursday , up 2 1\/2 points . </s>
<s> The yield on the benchmark fell to UNK % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to UNK Data Global Markets Group . </s>
<s> The `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a UNK fall in the stock market . </s>
<s> Treasurys opened lower , reacting UNK to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in September . </s>
<s> Bond prices barely UNK until midday . </s>
<s> Many bond market participants will be closely UNK the action of the Federal Reserve , which might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity to UNK the financial markets and keep the economy from slowing into a recession . </s>
<s> Prices of municipals , investment-grade UNK and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts . </s>
<s> Mortgage securities rose in UNK trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue . </s>
<s> The Ginnie Mae November 9 % issue ended at 98 UNK , up 7\/8 point on the day , to yield about UNK % to a 12-year average life assumption . </s>
<s> UNK corporate bonds were up about 1\/2 to 3\/4 point . </s>
<s> But the yield spread between UNK , investment-grade issues and UNK bonds widened . </s>
<s> And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority . </s>
<s> Despite rumors that the TVA 's long-awaited offering would be postponed because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said they expect the issue will be priced as scheduled . </s>
<s> One of the sources said the smaller portions of $ 750 million each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed . '' </s>
<s> Municipal bonds rose as much as 3\/4 point . </s>
<s> Roger UNK contributed to this article . </s>
<s> Friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come UNK the climate of anxiety that dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and UNK have been put in place to keep markets more UNK . </s>
<s> Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was UNK by Washington . </s>
<s> The consensus along the street seems to be that the plunge was triggered by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true the UNK began immediately after the UAL trading halt . </s>
<s> Still , the consensus seems almost as wide that one UNK bid is no reason to write down the value of all U.S. business . </s>
<s> This UNK leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones UNK shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in UNK the capital gains tax cut . </s>
<s> The real value of all shares , after all , is directly UNK by the tax on any profits ( all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that show gains are not `` ordinary income '' ) . </s>
<s> And market expectations clearly have been raised by the capital gains victory in the House last month . </s>
<s> An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped from the tax bill , leaving it with $ 5.4 billion in tax increases without a capital gains cut . </s>
<s> There is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for UNK the UNK out of the reconciliation bill . </s>
<s> It would be a good thing if Congress started to decide issues UNK on their individual merits without UNK . </s>
<s> For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an UNK vote . </s>
<s> Since Senate leaders have so far UNK it up with procedural UNK , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect . </s>
<s> UNK so since President Bush has been weakened by the Panama UNK . </s>
<s> To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's UNK UNK . </s>
<s> As the best opportunities for corporate UNK are UNK of course , at some point the market will start to reject them . </s>
<s> But the airlines are UNK a clear case , given anti-takeover UNK by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who UNK to believe safety will be UNK if UNK and British Airways own interests in companies that fly UNK . </s>
<s> Worse , Congress has started to jump on the Skinner UNK . </s>
<s> James UNK , the Minnesota Democrat who chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an UNK takeover bill on UNK speed so that it would be passed in time to affect the American and United Air Lines bids . </s>
<s> It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more . </s>
<s> So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points . </s>
<s> UNK , Mr. Secretary and Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> In the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a UNK UNK proposal to tax takeovers out of UNK . </s>
<s> Even more important , in our view , was the Treasury 's threat to UNK the dollar . </s>
<s> The Treasury is doing the same thing today ; UNK , the dollar is not under UNK pressure . </s>
<s> Also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling UNK . </s>
<s> They are better capitalized . </s>
<s> They are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape UNK and clearing and settlement delays . </s>
<s> The Fed promises any needed liquidity . </s>
<s> The Big Board 's UNK with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove to be a good idea . </s>
<s> In any event , some traders see stocks as UNK today , unlike 1987 . </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be UNK by a little UNK and common sense in Washington . </s>
<s> But on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect . </s>
<s> First Chicago Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ UNK million after joining other big banks in further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans . </s>
<s> The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion in assets , said it set aside $ 200 million to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries . </s>
<s> The addition , on top of two big 1987 UNK to UNK reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of UNK and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations . </s>
<s> First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion from $ 3 billion . </s>
<s> Despite this loss , First Chicago said it does n't need to sell stock to raise capital . </s>
<s> During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ UNK million from the sale of its First Chicago Investment UNK unit . </s>
<s> UNK foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ UNK million from $ UNK million . </s>
<s> UNK from First Chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy-out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million from $ UNK million a year ago . </s>
<s> Interest income and most fee income was strong . </s>
<s> The economy 's UNK will be taken from several UNK points this week , with UNK on trade , output , housing and inflation . </s>
<s> The most troublesome report may be the August merchandise trade deficit due out tomorrow . </s>
<s> The trade gap is expected to widen to about $ 9 billion from July 's $ 7.6 billion , according to a survey by UNK International , a unit of McGraw-Hill Inc. , New York . </s>
<s> Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported Friday in the producer price index . </s>
<s> That gain was being cited as a reason the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got started on its reckless 190-point plunge . </s>
<s> Economists are divided as to how much manufacturing strength they expect to see in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought to have inched upward . </s>
<s> `` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said Michael UNK , director of research at UNK . </s>
<s> A widening of the deficit , if it were combined with a UNK strong dollar , would UNK trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted . </s>
<s> In any event , Mr. UNK and many others say that the easy gains in narrowing the trade gap have already been made . </s>
<s> `` Trade is definitely going to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins to slow , '' he said . </s>
<s> Exports are thought to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough to offset the jump in imports , economists said . </s>
<s> UNK on manufacturing strength are split between economists who read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who use the somewhat more UNK total employment figures in their calculations . </s>
<s> The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number UNK the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to UNK . </s>
<s> A rebound in energy prices , which helped push up the producer price index , is expected to do the same in the consumer price report . </s>
<s> The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September UNK after a flat reading in August . </s>
<s> Robert H. UNK , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the UNK than in prices at the producer level . </s>

<s> Joseph UNK . </s>
<s> `` I 'm the only one who said there would be an October massacre , all through late August and September , '' says Mr. UNK , once a widely followed market UNK and still a well-known newsletter writer . </s>
<s> `` Everyone will tell you that this time is different from 1987 , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` Well , in some ways it is different , but technically it is just the same . </s>
<s> If you 're a UNK , you UNK the signals . </s>
<s> Right now they 're telling me to get the UNK out and stay out . </s>
<s> I see no major support until UNK . </s>
<s> I see a possibility of going to UNK this month . '' </s>
<s> Mr. UNK says he would n't even think of buying until at least 600 to 700 stocks have hit 52-week lows ; about 100 stocks hit new lows Friday . </s>
<s> `` Most people , '' he says , `` have no idea what a massacre pattern looks like . '' </s>
<s> UNK UNK . </s>
<s> A UNK analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. , Ms. UNK had warned clients to take their money out of the market before the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> Friday 's big drop , she says , `` was not a crash . </s>
<s> This was an October massacre '' like those that occurred in 1978 and 1979 . </s>
<s> Now , as in those two years , her stock market indicators are positive . </s>
<s> So she thinks the damage will be UNK and contained . </s>
<s> `` Those UNK lasted one to four weeks and took the market UNK % down , '' she says . </s>
<s> `` This is exactly the same thing , as far as I 'm concerned . '' </s>
<s> Thus , she says , if the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped below UNK , `` It would just be a UNK . </s>
<s> My advice is to buy . '' </s>
<s> As she UNK it , the average stock now sells for about 12.5 times companies ' earnings . </s>
<s> She says that ratio could climb to UNK , given current interest rates , and still be within the range of `` fair value . '' </s>
<s> UNK Davis . </s>
<s> Friday 's fall marks the start of a bear market , says Mr. Davis , president of UNK Davis Research Inc . </s>
<s> But Mr. Davis , whose views are widely respected by money managers , says he expects no UNK crash . </s>
<s> `` There was a unique combination in 1987 , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` UNK debt was at a record high . </s>
<s> There was tremendous public enthusiasm for stock mutual funds . </s>
<s> The main thing was portfolio insurance , '' a mechanical trading system intended to protect an investor against losses . `` </s>
<s> A hundred billion dollars in stock was subject '' to it . </s>
<s> In 1987 , such selling contributed to a UNK effect . </s>
<s> Today could even be an up day , Mr. Davis says , if major brokerage firms agree to UNK from program trading . </s>
<s> Over the next several months , though , he says things look bad . </s>
<s> `` I think the market will be heading down into November , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` We will probably have a year-end rally , and then go down again . </s>
<s> UNK of a UNK bear market . '' </s>
<s> He expects the downturn to carry the Dow Jones Industrial Average down to around 2000 sometime next year . </s>
<s> `` That would be a normal bear market , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` I guess that 's my forecast . '' </s>
<s> UNK G. UNK . </s>
<s> `` I do n't think the market is going through another October UNK . </s>
<s> I do n't think that 's the case at all , '' says Mr. UNK , a partner at Goldman , Sachs & Co. and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK sees this as a good time to pick up bargains , but he does n't think there 's any need to rush . </s>
<s> `` I expect the market to open weaker Monday , but then it should find some stability . '' </s>
<s> He UNK off several major differences between now and two years ago . </s>
<s> Unlike 1987 , interest rates have been falling this year . </s>
<s> Unlike 1987 , the dollar has been strong . </s>
<s> And unlike 1987 , the economy does n't appear to be in any danger of UNK . </s>
<s> But the economy 's slower growth this year also means the outlook for corporate profits `` is n't good , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` So it 's a very mixed bag . '' </s>
<s> Thus , he concludes , `` This is not a good environment to be fully invested '' in stocks . </s>
<s> `` If I had come into Friday on margin or with very little cash in the portfolios , I would not do any buying . </s>
<s> But we came into Friday with a conservative portfolio , so I would look to do some modest buying '' on behalf of clients . `` </s>

<s> `` This is the latest UNK of the capacity of the financial community for UNK UNK , '' says Mr. UNK , an economist . </s>
<s> `` I see this as a reaction to the whole junk bond explosion , '' he says . </s>

<s> This time , `` I do n't think we 'll get a panic reaction . </s>
<s> Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop . </s>
<s> That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans . </s>
<s> In October 1987 , these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward UNK of the stock market . </s>
<s> Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value . </s>
<s> If the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin UNK the securities . </s>
<s> But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls . </s>
<s> UNK calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. said . </s>
<s> Merrill Lynch & Co. officials `` do n't expect { margin calls } to be as big a factor as in 1987 '' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman said . </s>

<s> That shows how far Ted Turner 's Cable News Network has come since its birth nine years ago , when it was considered the UNK of television news . </s>
<s> It is bigger , faster and more profitable than the news divisions of any of the three major broadcast networks . </s>
<s> Its niche as the `` network of record '' during major crises draws UNK audiences around the world . </s>
<s> But for all its success , UNK has hit a UNK . </s>
<s> Although UNK UNK when big news breaks , it UNK during periods of UNK . </s>
<s> UNK executives worry that the network 's UNK but UNK news UNK may be getting UNK and wo n't keep viewers coming back as the alternatives UNK for news and information on UNK . </s>
<s> `` Just the fact we 're on 24 hours is no longer UNK , '' says Ed Turner , UNK 's executive vice president , news gathering ( and no UNK to Ted Turner ) . </s>
<s> `` You ca n't live on that . '' </s>
<s> So UNK , a unit of Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System Inc. , is trying to UNK itself as a primary channel , or what people in the television industry call a `` top of mind '' network . </s>
<s> UNK , to kick off the effort , UNK will premiere its first prime-time UNK in years , an UNK show at 6 p.m . Eastern time to air UNK against the network UNK . </s>
<s> The show will be UNK by Bernard Shaw and UNK UNK , a UNK former Texas judge and campus beauty UNK who has never held a job in television or journalism . </s>
<s> The new show is perhaps the UNK in a number of steps the network is taking to build audience loyalty by shifting away from its current UNK toward more UNK `` signature '' programming with UNK stars . </s>
<s> To UNK itself , UNK is also expanding international coverage and adding a second UNK program . </s>
<s> It is paying higher salaries -- after years of UNK -- to lure and keep experienced staffers . </s>
<s> And it is UNK on an expensive gamble to break major stories with a large UNK team . </s>
<s> `` The next stage is to get beyond the opinion leaders who use us as a point of reference to become a point of reference at ordinary dinner tables , '' says Jon UNK , executive vice president of UNK News , UNK 's sister network . </s>
<s> But that wo n't be easy . </s>
<s> UNK , like other consumer products , develop images in UNK ' minds that are n't easy to change . </s>
<s> It also takes money that UNK has been reluctant to spend to make programs and hire talent that viewers will tune in UNK to see . </s>
<s> And the UNK operators -- UNK 's distributors and part owners -- like things just the way they are . </s>
<s> The UNK bid is aimed at UNK 's UNK UNK -- and what may happen to it as the UNK news market grows more competitive . </s>
<s> Already , UNK is facing stronger competition from Financial News Network Inc. and General Electric Co. 's Consumer News and Business Channel , both of which are likely to pursue more general news in the future . </s>
<s> In addition , many UNK systems themselves are airing more local and regional news programs produced by local broadcast stations . </s>
<s> UNK wants to change its viewers ' habits . </s>
<s> Its watchers are , on the whole , a UNK group of UNK `` UNK '' and news UNK , who spend an average of just 26 minutes a day watching UNK , according to audience research . </s>
<s> That 's less than one-third the time that viewers watch the major broadcast networks . </s>
<s> The brief attention viewers give UNK could put it at a disadvantage as ratings data , and advertising , become more important to UNK channels . </s>
<s> UNK 's UNK habits have been UNK by its UNK . </s>
<s> Its strategy in the past has been to serve as a TV wire service . </s>
<s> It focused on building up its news UNK around the world , so as events took place it could go live UNK and longer than other networks . </s>
<s> It filled its daily schedule with UNK called `` UNK , '' `` UNK , '' `` UNK , '' and `` UNK , '' but the shows UNK little in content , UNK or look . </s>
<s> Now , the push is on for UNK shows . </s>
<s> `` Our goal is to create more programs with an individual identity , '' says Paul UNK , UNK executive vice president for programming . </s>
<s> UNK , UNK is adding a UNK show in the morning because surveys show its UNK hour in the afternoon is among its most `` UNK '' programs in viewers ' minds , says Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> And it is exploring other original programs , similar to its `` Larry King UNK '' and `` UNK '' talk shows , which executives hope will keep people UNK in . </s>
<s> Then there 's `` The World Today , '' the prime-time UNK featuring Mr. Shaw and Ms. UNK . </s>
<s> Until now , UNK has featured its Hollywood UNK show during the key evening period . </s>
<s> But 70 % of the UNK households that watch news do so between UNK p.m. and 7 p.m. , the network discovered , so UNK wants in . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK says the UNK team will probably do two live interviews a day , with most of the program , at least for now , appearing similar to UNK 's other UNK . </s>
<s> Some in the industry are skeptical . </s>
<s> `` I find it hard to UNK of people switching over to UNK for what , at least in the public 's mind , is the same news , '' says UNK Frank , the former UNK president of NBC News and UNK of the UNK Report . </s>
<s> The evening news is also slated as UNK 's stage for its big push into UNK journalism . </s>
<s> In August , the network hired UNK producer UNK Hill , the former head of news UNK at ABC . </s>
<s> She 's UNK a staff of about 35 UNK reporters who will produce weekly , UNK segments , with an eye toward breaking big stories . </s>
<s> UNK executives hope the UNK created by such UNK will generate excitement for its `` UNK '' programs , in the way `` 60 UNK '' did so well for CBS . </s>
<s> That 's such a departure from the past that many in the industry are skeptical UNK will follow through with its UNK commitment , especially after it sees the cost of producing UNK pieces . </s>
<s> `` They 've never shown any UNK to spend money on production , '' says Michael UNK , a senior producer with UNK UNK , who notes that UNK is UNK to his job . </s>
<s> The network 's salaries have always ranged far below industry standards , resulting in a UNK work force . </s>
<s> UNK recently gave most employees raises of as much as 15 % , but they 're still drastically UNK compared with the networks . </s>
<s> Says Mr. UNK : `` UNK is my wire service ; they 're on top of everything . </s>
<s> But to improve , they 've really got to make the investment in people . '' </s>
<s> In any case , UNK operators have reason to fear any UNK with UNK 's UNK . </s>
<s> They market UNK on the very UNK opportunities UNK seeks to discourage . </s>
<s> `` We would obviously be upset if those kinds of services UNK into more UNK , UNK programming , '' says Robert UNK , senior vice president , programming , of Continental UNK Inc. , which holds a 2 % stake in Turner Broadcasting . </s>
<s> The official White House reaction to a plunge in stock prices has a UNK history of UNK , right up through Friday . </s>

<s> UNK Inc. , following rival UNK Corp. 's lead , said it is backing out of UNK programs with three airlines . </s>
<s> The Garden City , N.Y. , UNK company said it wo n't renew contracts with NWA Inc. 's Northwest Airlines unit , Pan Am Corp. 's Pan American World Airways unit and UNK Airlines at the end of this year . </s>
<s> But it remains involved in programs with AMR Corp. 's American Airlines unit and Delta Air Lines . </s>
<s> Industry estimates put UNK 's annual cost of all five programs at between $ 8 million and $ 14 million . </s>
<s> A spokesman for UNK would n't specify the costs but said the three airlines being dropped account for `` far less than half '' of the total . </s>
<s> Budget UNK a Car Corp. , of Chicago , and National Car UNK Systems Inc. , of Minneapolis , both said they had no plans to follow suit . </s>
<s> In fact , Budget indicated it saw some benefit to staying involved in these programs , in which UNK earn UNK miles and UNK can get UNK discounts . </s>
<s> `` I can not see how this news by UNK and UNK can not benefit Budget 's programs , '' said Bob Wilson , Budget 's vice president , marketing planning . </s>
<s> Northwest and UNK are two of the five airlines with which Budget has agreements . </s>
<s> National also UNK in the Northwest UNK program along with four other airlines , including Delta and USAir Group Inc. 's USAir unit . </s>
<s> A month ago , UNK , of Park UNK , N.J. , said that it would drop its marketing agreements at year end with Delta , America West and Texas Air Corp. 's Continental Airlines and Eastern Airlines , and that UNK with American Airlines , UAL Inc 's United Airlines and USAir also would be ended ... sometime after Dec. 31 . </s>
<s> At the time , UNK said its annual fees to those airlines amounted to $ 20 million and that the value of redeemed UNK topped $ 15 million . </s>
<s> Analysts and competitors , however , doubt the numbers were that high . </s>
<s> Budget said its UNK costs are `` substantially below '' UNK 's level . </s>
<s> Robert D. UNK , UNK vice president of marketing , said , `` The proliferation and costs attached to { UNK programs } have significantly diminished their value . '' </s>
<s> This year has been difficult for both UNK and UNK , said Charles UNK , UNK industry analyst at Alex . Brown & Sons . </s>
<s> `` They 've been looking to get their costs down , and this is a fairly UNK way to do it , '' he said . </s>
<s> UNK Inc. expects fiscal second-quarter earnings to trail 1988 results , but anticipates that several new products will lead to a `` much stronger '' performance in its second half . </s>
<s> UNK , a telecommunications company , had net income of $ UNK , or five cents a share , in its year-earlier second quarter , ended Sept. 30 . </s>
<s> Revenue totaled $ 5 million . </s>
<s> George UNK , chairman and chief executive officer , said in an interview that earnings in the most recent quarter will be about two cents a share on revenue of just under $ 4 million . </s>
<s> The lower results , Mr. UNK said , reflect a 12-month decline in industry sales of privately owned pay UNK , UNK 's primary business . </s>
<s> Although Mr. UNK expects that line of business to strengthen in the next year , he said UNK will also benefit from moving into other areas . </s>
<s> UNK among those is the company 's UNK into the public facsimile business , Mr. UNK said . </s>
<s> Within the next year , UNK expects to place 10,000 UNK machines , made by UNK in Japan , in hotels , municipal buildings , UNK and other public UNK around the country . </s>
<s> UNK will provide a credit-card reader for the machines to collect , store and forward billing data . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK said UNK should realize a minimum of $ 10 of UNK net earnings for each machine each month . </s>
<s> UNK has also developed an automatic call UNK that will make further use of the company 's system for UNK and handling credit-card calls and collect calls . </s>
<s> UNK call processors will provide that system for virtually any telephone , Mr. UNK said , not just phones produced by UNK . </s>
<s> The company will also be producing a new line of convenience UNK , which do n't accept coins , for use in hotel UNK , office UNK , UNK UNK and similar UNK . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK estimated that the processors and convenience phones would produce about $ 5 of UNK net earnings for each machine each month . </s>
<s> When Justice William UNK marks the start of his UNK year on the Supreme Court today , the UNK will differ sharply from previous UNK of his tenure . </s>
<s> For the first time , the UNK justice finds his influence almost exclusively in UNK , rather than as a force in the high court 's majority . </s>
<s> This role reversal holds true , as well , for his three liberal and moderate allies , UNK UNK Marshall , Harry UNK and John Stevens . </s>
<s> But are these four players , three of them in their UNK , ready to assume a different role after 88 years , UNK , of service on the high court ? </s>
<s> Every indication is that the four are prepared to accept this new role , and the UNK that go with it , but in different ways . </s>
<s> UNK UNK and Stevens appear UNK about it ; UNK Marshall and UNK appear fighting UNK . </s>
<s> The four UNK are no newcomers to UNK , often joining forces in the past decade to UNK the court 's conservative UNK . </s>
<s> But always , in years past , they have UNK the trend and have been able to pick up a fifth vote to UNK out a number of major UNK in civil rights and UNK cases . </s>
<s> Now , however , as the court 's new UNK conservative majority continues to UNK , UNK for the liberals are rare . </s>
<s> The change is most dramatic for Justice UNK , the last UNK of the UNK liberal majority under Chief Justice UNK Warren . </s>
<s> In the seven Supreme Court terms from the fall of UNK through the spring of 1967 , the UNK of the Warren Court 's power , Justice UNK cast only 25 UNK votes in UNK cases decided by the court . </s>
<s> Last term alone he cast 52 UNK votes in UNK decisions , with the UNK UNK ruling as his only big victory . </s>
<s> But Justice UNK UNK his new role , strongly defending the importance of UNK in a 1985 speech . </s>
<s> `` Each time the court UNK an issue , the UNK will be forced by a UNK to reconsider the fundamental questions and to UNK the result , '' he said . </s>
<s> Moreover , in recent months he has said that when he was on the winning side in the 1960s , he knew that the tables might turn in the future . </s>
<s> He has said that he now knows how Justice John UNK felt , a reference to the late conservative justice who was the most frequent UNK from the Warren Court 's opinions . </s>
<s> Associates of UNK Justice Marshall say he was `` depressed '' about the court 's direction last spring , but is UNK about his role and determined to speak out against the court 's cutbacks in civil rights . </s>
<s> `` We could sweep it under the UNK and hide it , but I 'm not going to do it , '' he said in a speech last month . </s>
<s> He , like Justice UNK , considers UNK highly important for the future , a point that has n't escaped legal scholars . </s>
<s> Harvard Law School UNK Laurence UNK says there is a `` UNK '' flavor to current UNK . </s>
<s> The UNK in the Warren Court , he says , appeared to be writing for the short-term , suggesting that the court 's direction might change soon . </s>
<s> `` UNK and Marshall are speaking in their UNK to a more distant future , '' he says . </s>
<s> Justice UNK , who will turn 81 next month , also seems UNK about his new role . </s>
<s> Associates say he takes some UNK more personally than his colleagues , especially attempts to curtail the right to abortion first recognized in his 1973 opinion , Roe vs. Wade . </s>
<s> UNK and associates who saw Justice UNK during the summer said he was no more UNK about the court than in recent years . </s>
<s> And his outlook improved after successful UNK surgery in August . </s>
<s> But his level of frustration showed in a recent , UNK speech to a group of hundreds of lawyers in Chicago . </s>
<s> He concluded his remarks by UNK , UNK and at some length , according to those present , the late Martin UNK King 's famous `` I Have a UNK '' speech from the 1963 March on Washington . </s>
<s> Justice Stevens , 69 , is probably the most UNK of the UNK about his role , in part because he may be the least liberal of the four , but also because he enjoys the intellectual challenge of arguing with the majority more than the others . </s>
<s> If the role these four UNK are assuming is a familiar one in modern Supreme Court history , it also UNK in an important way from recent history , court watchers say . </s>
<s> `` The UNK of the Warren Court were often defending a legal UNK that they inherited , '' says Prof. UNK Dick Howard of the University of Virginia Law School , `` but the UNK today are defending a UNK that they created . </s>
<s> On a recent Saturday night , in the midst of West Germany 's most popular prime-time show , a UNK bet the host that she could name any of 100 different UNK after just one UNK , while UNK . </s>
<s> The woman won the bet . </s>
<s> But perhaps even more remarkable , the UNK , `` UNK UNK '' ( Make a UNK ) , regularly wins the top UNK in the country 's TV ratings , sometimes drawing as many as 50 % of West German households . </s>
<s> As the 1992 economic integration approaches , Europe 's cultural UNK have taken to the UNK against American `` cultural UNK , '' threatening to impose quotas against such pop UNK as `` Dallas , '' `` Miami Vice '' and `` L.A. Law . '' </s>
<s> But much of what the Europeans want to protect seems every bit as UNK as what they are trying to keep out . </s>
<s> The most UNK opposition to American TV imports has come from French television and movie producers , who have demanded quotas ensuring that a full 60 % of Europe 's TV shows be produced in Europe . </s>
<s> So far , the French have failed to win enough broad-based support to prevail . </s>
<s> A UNK through the television UNK and a few UNK of the European television UNK suggest one reason why . </s>
<s> While there are some popular action and drama series , few UNK the high culture and UNK production values one might expect . </s>
<s> More European air time is filled with UNK game shows , variety hours , movies and talk shows , many of which are authorized UNK of their American counterparts . </s>
<s> One of France 's most popular Saturday night programs features UNK seeking out their UNK UNK for UNK UNK . </s>
<s> A UNK game show has as its host a Belgian UNK to be Italian . </s>
<s> One of Italy 's favorite shows , `` UNK , '' a UNK variety show , is so popular that viewers UNK to buy a UNK product , `` UNK UNK , '' whose UNK were UNK each week by UNK UNK -- even though the product did n't exist . </s>
<s> UNK the UNK UNK , on another typical evening of fun on `` UNK UNK , '' a UNK won a bet with the show 's host , Thomas UNK , that he could identify 300 German UNK over the telephone . </s>
<s> A UNK guest , U.S. UNK to West Germany Richard Burt , also won a bet that someone could UNK up $ 150 worth of quarters on a UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Mr. Burt nonetheless paid the penalty as if he had lost , agreeing to spend a day with West German Foreign Minister UNK UNK UNK and selling their combined weight in UNK UNK . </s>
<s> If this seems like pretty weak stuff around which to raise the UNK barriers , it may be because these shows need all the protection they can get . </s>
<s> European programs usually target only their own local audience , and often only a small portion of that . </s>
<s> UNK in Germany or Italy rarely make it even to France or Great Britain , and almost never show up on U.S. screens . </s>
<s> UNK to produce `` UNK '' programs have generally resulted in disappointment . </s>
<s> One annual UNK , the UNK `` UNK UNK UNK , '' featuring UNK UNK from each of 20 European countries , has been described as the world 's most boring TV show . </s>
<s> Another , `` UNK UNK UNK , '' where UNK from UNK European countries make UNK of themselves performing UNK tasks , is a hit in France . </s>
<s> A UNK UNK under the title `` Almost UNK UNK '' UNK fast . </s>
<s> For the most part , what 's made here stays here , and for good reason . </s>
<s> The UNK of the British crop , the literary UNK that are shown on U.S. public television as `` UNK UNK , '' make up a relatively small part of British air time . </s>
<s> Most British programming is more of an acquired taste . </s>
<s> There is , for instance , `` One Man and His UNK , '' a UNK contest among UNK dogs . </s>
<s> Also UNK to the British are hours of UNK UNK , even more hours of lawn bowling UNK and still more hours of UNK UNK . </s>
<s> European drama has had better , though still mixed , fortunes . </s>
<s> The most popular such shows focus on narrow national concerns . </s>

<s> When the price of plastics took off in 1987 , Quantum Chemical Corp. went along for the ride . </s>
<s> The timing of Quantum 's chief executive officer , John UNK UNK , appeared to be nothing less than inspired , because he had just increased Quantum 's reliance on plastics . </s>
<s> The company UNK much of the chemical industry as annual profit grew UNK in two years . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK said of the boom , `` It 's going to last a whole lot longer than anybody thinks . '' </s>
<s> But now prices have UNK and Quantum 's profit is UNK . </s>

<s> The stock , having lost nearly a quarter of its value since Sept. 1 , closed at $ UNK share , down $ 1.125 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday . </s>
<s> To a degree , Quantum represents the new times that have arrived for producers of the so-called commodity plastics that UNK modern life . </s>
<s> Having just passed through one of the most profitable periods in their history , these producers now see their prices UNK . </s>
<s> UNK cycles , to be sure , are nothing new for plastics producers . </s>
<s> And the financial decline of some looks steep only in comparison with the UNK period that is just behind them . </s>
<s> `` We were all UNK UNK last year , '' says an executive at one of Quantum 's competitors . </s>
<s> `` Now we 're at the bottom of the UNK . '' </s>
<s> At Quantum , which is based in New York , the trouble is UNK by the company 's heavy UNK on plastics . </s>
<s> Once known as National UNK & Chemical Corp. , the company UNK the wine and spirits business and UNK more of its resources into plastics after Mr. UNK took the chief executive 's job in 1986 . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK , 59 years old , declined to be interviewed for this article , but he has consistently argued that over the long haul -- across both the UNK and the UNK of the plastics market -- Quantum will UNK through its new direction . </s>
<s> Quantum 's lot is mostly tied to polyethylene UNK , used to make UNK bags , milk UNK , UNK , UNK and meat packaging , among other items . </s>
<s> In the U.S. polyethylene market , Quantum has claimed the largest share , about 20 % . </s>
<s> But its competitors -- including Dow Chemical Co. , Union Carbide Corp. and several oil giants -- have much broader business interests and so are better UNK against price swings . </s>
<s> When the price of polyethylene moves a mere penny a pound , Quantum 's annual profit UNK by about 85 cents a share , provided no other UNK are changing . </s>
<s> In recent months the price of polyethylene , even more than that of other commodity plastics , has taken a dive . </s>
<s> UNK grades , which still sold for as much as 50 cents a pound last spring , have skidded to between 35 cents and 40 cents . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , the price of UNK , the chemical building block of polyethylene , has n't dropped nearly so fast . </s>
<s> That UNK UNK Quantum badly , because its own plants cover only about half of its UNK needs . </s>
<s> By many accounts , an early UNK of a price UNK in the making came at the start of this year . </s>
<s> China , which had been putting in huge orders for polyethylene , abruptly halted them . </s>
<s> UNK that excess polyethylene would soon be UNK around the world , other buyers then bet that prices had peaked and so began to draw down inventories rather than order new product . </s>
<s> Kenneth Mitchell , director of Dow 's polyethylene business , says producers were surprised to learn how much inventories had swelled throughout the distribution chain as prices UNK up . </s>
<s> `` People were even UNK bags , '' he says . </s>
<s> Now producers hope prices have hit bottom . </s>
<s> They recently announced increases of a few cents a pound to take effect in the next several weeks . </s>
<s> No one knows , however , whether the new posted prices will stick once producers and customers start to UNK . </s>
<s> One UNK is George UNK , a UNK analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. and a bear on plastics stocks . </s>
<s> UNK others ' estimates of when price increases can be sustained , he remarks , `` Some say October . </s>
<s> Some say November . </s>
<s> I say 1992 . '' </s>
<s> He argues that efforts to firm up prices will be undermined by producers ' plans to expand production capacity . </s>
<s> A quick turnaround is crucial to Quantum because its cash requirements remain heavy . </s>
<s> The company is trying to carry out a three-year , $ 1.3 billion UNK program started this year . </s>
<s> At the same time , its annual payments on long-term debt will more than double from a year ago to about $ 240 million , largely because of debt taken on to pay a $ UNK special dividend earlier this year . </s>
<s> Quantum described the UNK at the time as a way for it to share the UNK with its holders , because its stock price was n't reflecting the huge profit increases . </s>
<s> Some analysts saw the payment as an effort also to UNK takeover speculation . </s>
<s> Whether a cash crunch might eventually force the company to cut its quarterly dividend , raised 36 % to 75 cents a share only a year ago , has become a topic of intense speculation on Wall Street since Mr. UNK UNK dividend questions in a Sept. 29 meeting with analysts . </s>
<s> Some viewed his response -- that company directors review the dividend regularly -- as nothing more than the standard line from executives . </s>
<s> But others came away thinking he had given something less than his usual UNK performance . </s>
<s> In any case , on the day of the meeting , Quantum 's shares slid $ UNK to $ UNK in Big Board trading . </s>
<s> On top of everything else , Quantum UNK a disaster at its plant in Morris , Ill . </s>
<s> After an explosion UNK the plant in June , the company UNK in September to within 12 hours of completing the UNK process of UNK it . </s>
<s> Then a second explosion occurred . </s>
<s> Two workers died and six remain in the hospital . </s>
<s> This human toll adds the most painful UNK yet to the sudden change in Quantum 's fortunes . </s>
<s> Until this year , the company had been steadily lowering its accident rate and picking up UNK safety UNK . </s>
<s> A prolonged production halt at the plant could introduce another UNK into Quantum 's financial future . </s>
<s> When a plant has just been running flat out to meet demand , UNK lost profit and thus claims under UNK insurance is UNK . </s>
<s> But the numbers become UNK -- and subject to UNK between insured and insurer -- when demand is shifting . </s>
<s> `` You say you could have sold UNK percent of this product and UNK percent of that , '' recalls UNK UNK , an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton who went through this exercise during his former career as a chemical engineer . </s>
<s> `` And then you still have to negotiate . '' </s>
<s> Quantum hopes the Morris plant , where limited production got under way last week , will resume full operation by year 's end . </s>
<s> The plant usually accounts for 20 % to 25 % of Quantum 's polyethylene production and 50 % of its UNK production . </s>
<s> Not everything looks grim for Quantum . </s>
<s> The plant expansion should strengthen the company 's UNK in the polyethylene business , where market share is often taken through sheer capacity . </s>
<s> By UNK UNK production , the expansion will also lower the company 's raw material costs . </s>
<s> Quantum is also UNK its grip on its one large business outside chemicals , UNK marketing . </s>
<s> Through a venture with its investment banker , First Boston Corp. , Quantum completed in August an acquisition of UNK Inc. in a transaction valued at $ 1.18 billion . </s>
<s> UNK is the second-largest UNK distributor in the U.S. . </s>
<s> The largest , UNK UNK , was already owned by Quantum . </s>
<s> Still , Quantum has a crisis to get past right now . </s>
<s> Some analysts speculate the weakening stock may yet attract a suitor . </s>
<s> The name UNK in rumors is British Petroleum Co. , which is looking to expand its polyethylene business in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Asked about a bid for Quantum , a UNK spokesman says , `` We pretty much have a policy of not commenting on rumors , and I think that falls in that category . </s>
<s> UNK of Call Inc. reached agreements to sell its remaining seven aircraft to buyers that were n't disclosed . </s>
<s> The agreements bring to a total of nine the number of planes the travel company has sold this year as part of a restructuring . </s>
<s> The company said a portion of the $ 32 million realized from the sales will be used to repay its bank debt and other obligations resulting from the currently suspended UNK operations . </s>
<s> Earlier the company announced it would sell its aging fleet of Boeing Co. UNK because of increasing maintenance costs . </s>
<s> Sharp increases in the price of fresh produce caused Spain 's September consumer price index to UNK up 1.1 % from the previous month , pushing the annual rate of inflation to 6.8 % , the National Institute of Statistics said Friday . </s>
<s> The monthly increase is the highest recorded in the past four years . </s>
<s> The index , which registered UNK at the end of September , has a base of 100 set in 1983 and is n't seasonally adjusted . </s>
<s> Prices have risen 5.9 % in the first nine months of the year , UNK both the initial 3 % inflation goal set by the government of Socialist Prime Minister UNK Gonzalez and the second , revised goal of 5.8 % . </s>
<s> Of all the ethnic UNK in America , which is the most troublesome right now ? </s>
<s> A good bet would be the tension between blacks and UNK in New York City . </s>
<s> Or so it must seem to UNK Mason , the veteran Jewish UNK appearing in a new ABC UNK airing on Tuesday nights ( UNK p.m. EDT ) . </s>
<s> Not only is Mr. Mason the star of `` UNK Soup , '' he 's also the UNK of a UNK tradition UNK back to `` UNK Soup , '' and he 's currently a man in hot water . </s>
<s> Here , in UNK language , is the UNK of Mr. Mason 's remarks , quoted first in the UNK Voice while he was a paid spokesman for the Rudolph Giuliani mayoral campaign , and then in Newsweek after he and the campaign UNK company . </s>
<s> Mr. Mason said that many Jewish voters feel guilty toward blacks , so they support black candidates UNK . </s>
<s> He said that many black voters feel bitter about racial discrimination , so they , too , support black candidates UNK . </s>
<s> He said that UNK have contributed more to black causes over the years than vice UNK . </s>
<s> Of course , Mr. Mason did not use UNK language . </s>
<s> As a UNK of ethnic humor from the old days on the UNK UNK , live television and the UNK circuit , Mr. Mason UNK reached for the UNK . </s>
<s> He said UNK were `` sick with UNK '' ; and he called David Dinkins , Mr. Giuliani 's black opponent , `` a fancy UNK with a UNK . '' </s>
<s> If Mr. Mason had used less UNK language to UNK his UNK analysis of the voting behavior of his fellow New UNK , would the water be quite so hot ? </s>
<s> It probably would , because few or none of the people upset by Mr. Mason 's remarks have bothered to UNK between the substance of his comments and the fact that he used UNK language . </s>
<s> In addition , some of Mr. Mason 's critics have implied that his type of ethnic humor is itself a form of UNK . </s>
<s> For example , the New York state counsel for the UNK said that Mr. Mason is `` like a UNK . </s>
<s> People are fast leaving the place where he is stuck . '' </s>
<s> These critics fail to UNK between the type of ethnic humor that aims at UNK another group , such as `` Polish jokes '' ; and the type that is UNK , aiming UNK as well as UNK . </s>
<s> The latter typically is the humor of the UNK , and it was UNK by both blacks and UNK on the UNK and UNK stage as a means of UNK their white and UNK audiences along with themselves . </s>
<s> In the hands of a UNK like UNK Bruce , this UNK UNK could cut both the UNK and the audience to UNK . </s>
<s> But UNK by a pro like UNK Mason , it is a UNK form of UNK . </s>
<s> Why UNK ? </s>
<s> Because despite all the media UNK about comedy and politics not UNK , they are similar in one respect : Both can serve as UNK for easing UNK and UNK the UNK of groups in conflict . </s>
<s> That 's why it 's dangerous to have UNK thought police , on college UNK and elsewhere , UNK all critical mention of group differences . </s>
<s> As Elizabeth UNK wrote in the New York Times just before the Mason UNK , `` Perhaps UNK would not UNK over with such intensity if honest differences were allowed to UNK . '' </s>
<s> The question is , if group conflicts still exist ( as UNK they do ) , and if Mr. Mason 's type of ethnic humor is UNK , then what other means do we have for letting off steam ? </s>
<s> Do n't say the TV UNK , because that happens to be a UNK that , in its desperate need to attract everybody and UNK nobody , UNK politics more than it does comedy . </s>
<s> It is true that the best UNK do allow group differences to UNK : UNK vs. UNK UNK in `` UNK '' ; children vs. adults in `` The Cosby Show . '' </s>
<s> But these are not the differences that make UNK . </s>
<s> In `` UNK Soup , '' Mr. Mason plays UNK , a Jewish UNK UNK UNK ( Lynn UNK ) , an UNK widow and mother of three , against the wishes of his mother ( UNK UNK ) and her brother Michael ( UNK UNK ) . </s>
<s> It 's worth noting that both UNK UNK are UNK . </s>
<s> At least , they both speak with strong UNK , as do UNK and UNK . </s>
<s> It could n't be more obvious that `` UNK Soup '' is being made from an old UNK . </s>
<s> And a safe one -- imagine if the UNK in question were between an UNK UNK and a member of the UNK of UNK . </s>
<s> Back in the 1920s , the play and movie versions of `` UNK 's UNK Rose '' made the theme of UNK between the UNK UNK of Jewish and UNK UNK so popular that its author , Anne UNK , lost a UNK suit on the grounds that the plot has entered the public UNK . </s>
<s> And it has remained there , as UNK by its UNK in a 1972 CBS UNK called `` UNK UNK UNK , '' whose sole UNK was that it led to the UNK marriage of Meredith UNK and David UNK . </s>
<s> Clearly , the question with `` UNK Soup '' is not whether the UNK will UNK over , but whether it will UNK at all . </s>
<s> So far , the UNK have been few and far between . </s>
<s> Part of the problem is the tendency of all UNK , ever since the UNK days of Norman UNK , to UNK about social issues . </s>
<s> To some extent , this tendency emerges whenever the show tries to UNK us about ethnic UNK by UNK them . </s>
<s> For instance , Michael UNK UNK not because he 's a UNK Jewish businessman , but because he UNK his UNK job as a salesman in order to become a social worker . </s>
<s> Even more UNK is the UNK between UNK UNK and Mr. Mason 's comic UNK . </s>
<s> The best moments in the show occur at the beginning and the end ( and occasionally in the middle ) , when Mr. Mason UNK into his UNK UNK and starts UNK out that UNK Jewish UNK to other people as well as to himself . </s>
<s> But too often , these UNK lack spark because this UNK , like all UNK , is UNK about UNK Mr. Mason 's stock in trade - ethnic differences . </s>
<s> I 'm not suggesting that the producers start putting together episodes about topics like the UNK dispute over the UNK UNK at UNK . </s>
<s> That issue , like racial UNK in New York City , will have to cool down , not heat up , before it can UNK . </s>
<s> But I am suggesting that they stop requiring Mr. Mason to UNK his classic UNK with some line about `` UNK for other people '' that would sound UNK on the UNK of Miss America . </s>
<s> At your age , UNK , you ought to know that you ca n't make UNK without turning up the UNK . </s>
<s> Salomon Brothers International Ltd. , a British subsidiary of Salomon Inc. , announced it will issue warrants on shares of Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd . </s>
<s> The move closely follows a similar offer by Salomon of warrants for shares of UNK & UNK Banking Corp . </s>
<s> Under the latest offer , HK$ 62.5 million ( US$ 8 million ) of three-year warrants will be issued in London , each giving buyers the right to buy one Hong Kong Telecommunications share at a price to be determined Friday . </s>
<s> The 50 million warrants will be priced at HK$ 1.25 each and are expected to carry a premium to the share price of about 26 % . </s>
<s> In trading on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong , the shares closed Wednesday at HK$ UNK each . </s>
<s> At this price , the shares would have to rise above HK$ UNK for subscribers to Salomon 's issue to UNK convert their warrants . </s>
<s> While Hong Kong companies have in the past issued warrants on their own shares , Salomon 's warrants are the first here to be issued by a third party . </s>
<s> Salomon will `` cover '' the warrants by buying sufficient shares , or options to purchase shares , to cover its entire position . </s>
<s> Bankers said warrants for Hong Kong stocks are attractive because they give foreign investors , wary of volatility in the colony 's stock market , an opportunity to buy shares without taking too great a risk . </s>
<s> The Hong Kong Telecommunications warrants should be attractive to buyers in Europe , the bankers added , because the group is one of a handful of blue-chip stocks on the Hong Kong market that has international appeal . </s>
<s> UNK UNK may soon be replaced by UNK in the UNK room . </s>
<s> Procter & Gamble Co. plans to begin testing next month a UNK UNK that will require only a few UNK per UNK . </s>
<s> The move stems from UNK learned in Japan where local competitors have had UNK success with concentrated UNK . </s>
<s> It also marks P&G 's growing concern that its Japanese rivals , such as UNK Corp. , may bring their UNK to the U.S. . </s>
<s> The Cincinnati UNK giant got UNK two years ago in Japan when UNK introduced a powerful UNK , called UNK , which quickly won a 30 % stake in the Japanese markets . </s>
<s> `` They do n't want to get caught again , '' says one industry UNK . </s>
<s> UNK in Phoenix , Ariz. , say P&G 's new UNK UNK -- to be called UNK with Color Guard -- will be on UNK in that market by early November . </s>
<s> A P&G spokeswoman confirmed that shipments to Phoenix started late last month . </s>
<s> She said the company will study results from this market before expanding to others . </s>
<s> UNK are n't entirely new for P&G . </s>
<s> The company introduced a UNK UNK UNK in Japan after watching the success of UNK . </s>
<s> When UNK hit the UNK in 1987 , P&G 's share of the Japanese market fell to about 8 % from more than 20 % . </s>
<s> With the help of UNK UNK , P&G 's share is now estimated to be 12 % . </s>
<s> While the Japanese have embraced the compact packaging and convenience of concentrated products , the true test for P&G will be in the $ 4 billion U.S. UNK market , where growth is slow and UNK have gained UNK over UNK . </s>
<s> The company may have chosen to market the product under the UNK name since it 's already expanded its UNK UNK into 16 different UNK , including this year 's big hit , UNK with UNK . </s>
<s> With UNK , however , it is n't always easy to persuade consumers that less is more ; many people tend to dump too much UNK into the UNK machine , UNK that it takes a cup of UNK to really clean the UNK . </s>
<s> In the early 1980s , P&G tried to launch here a concentrated UNK under the UNK brand name that it markets in Europe . </s>
<s> But the product , which was n't as concentrated as the new UNK , UNK in a market test in Denver and was dropped . </s>
<s> P&G and others also have tried repeatedly to hook consumers on UNK and fabric UNK UNK in UNK , but they have n't sold well , despite the convenience . </s>
<s> But P&G contends the new UNK is a unique formula that also offers an UNK that prevents colors from UNK . </s>
<s> And retailers are expected to UNK the product , in part because it will take up less shelf space . </s>
<s> `` When shelf space was cheap , bigger was better , '' says UNK UNK , an analyst at Salomon UNK . </s>
<s> But with so many brands UNK for space , that 's no longer the case . </s>
<s> If the new UNK sells well , the trend toward smaller packaging is likely to accelerate as competitors follow with their own UNK . </s>
<s> Then retailers `` will probably push the { UNK } brands out altogether , '' he says . </s>
<s> UNK is bound to get tougher if UNK UNK a product like UNK in the U.S. . </s>
<s> To be sure , UNK would n't have an easy time taking U.S. market share away from the UNK P&G , which has about 23 % of the market . </s>
<s> UNK officials previously have said they are interested in selling UNK in the U.S. , but so far the company has focused on acquisitions , such as last year 's purchase of Andrew UNK Co. , a Cincinnati UNK maker . </s>
<s> It also has a UNK facility in California . </s>
<s> Some believe P&G 's interest in a UNK UNK goes beyond the concern for the Japanese . </s>
<s> `` This is something P&G would do with or without UNK , '' says Mr. UNK . </s>

<s> Time magazine , in a move to reduce the costs of UNK new subscribers , is lowering its circulation guarantee to advertisers for the second consecutive year , increasing its UNK rates and cutting back on merchandise UNK . </s>
<s> In an announcement to its staff last week , executives at Time Warner Inc.

<s> In a related development , the UNK , for the fourth year in a row , said it wo n't increase its advertising rates in 1990 ; a full , UNK page in the magazine costs about $ UNK . </s>
<s> However , because the guaranteed circulation base is being lowered , ad rates will be effectively 7.5 % higher per subscriber , according to Richard UNK , Time associate publisher . </s>
<s> Time is following the course of some other UNK magazines that in recent years have challenged the publishing UNK that maintaining UNK high , and expensive , UNK is the way to draw advertisers . </s>
<s> In recent years , UNK 's Digest , New York Times Co. 's McCall 's , and most recently News Corp. 's TV UNK , have cut their massive circulation rate bases to eliminate marginal circulation and hold down rates for advertisers . </s>
<s> UNK discounts in UNK and offers of free UNK UNK and watches have become accepted forms of attracting new subscribers in the UNK world of magazine UNK . </s>
<s> But Time , as part of the more UNK Time Warner , wants to UNK itself away from expensive UNK . </s>
<s> Besides , Time executives think selling a news magazine with a UNK radio is UNK . </s>
<s> `` UNK just give people the wrong image , '' said Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> `` That perception takes the focus off the magazine . '' </s>
<s> Time magazine executives UNK UNK the circulation cut as a show of strength and actually a benefit to advertisers . </s>

<s> In July , the company stunned Wall Street with the UNK that growth in the personal computer business overall would be only 10 % in 1990 , a modest increase when compared with the UNK expansion of years past . </s>
<s> Investors -- taking this as a sign that a broad industry slump was in the UNK -- reacted by selling the company 's stock , which lost $ 3.25 that day to close at $ 52 in national over-the-counter trading . </s>

<s> `` It 's hard to know what to expect at this point , '' said Peter UNK , an analyst at Robertson UNK & Co . </s>
<s> `` The industry UNK UNK . '' </s>
<s> To illustrate , Mr. UNK said that of the 14 UNK firms he follows , half will report for their most recent quarter earnings below last year 's results , and half above those results . </s>
<s> Among those companies expected to have a down quarter are Hewlett-Packard Co. , UNK Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc. , generally solid performers in the past . </s>

<s> Another UNK message comes from UNK Inc. , a computer retailer . </s>
<s> In July , the company reported that booming sales of new personal computers from Apple and IBM had resulted in net income more than doubling for its fourth quarter ended June 30 to $ 7.4 million , or 23 cents a share . </s>

<s> In personal computers , Apple , Compaq and IBM are expected to UNK their hold on their business . </s>
<s> At the same time , UNK firms will continue to lose ground . </s>

<s> Until recently , industry analysts believed UNK in retail ad spending had UNK out and would in fact increase in this year 's third and fourth quarters . </s>
<s> All UNK are off , analysts say , because of the shifting ownership of the retail chains . </s>
<s> `` UNK paper prices will help offset weakness in UNK , but the retailers ' problems have affected the amount of ad UNK they usually run , '' said Edward J. UNK , industry analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc . </s>
<s> `` UNK are just in disarray . '' </s>
<s> For instance , UNK Co. posted an 11 % gain in net income , as total ad pages dropped at USA Today , but advertising revenue rose because of a higher circulation rate base and increased rates . </s>

<s> At USA Today , ad pages totaled UNK for the quarter , down 9.2 % from the 1988 period , which was helped by increased ad spending from the UNK Olympics . </s>
<s> While USA Today 's total paid ad pages for the year to date totaled UNK , a decrease of 4 % from last year , the paper 's ad revenue increased 8 % in the quarter and 13 % in the nine months . </s>
<s> In the nine months , UNK 's net rose 9.5 % to $ 270 million , or $ UNK a share , from $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share . </s>
<s> Revenue gained 6 % to $ UNK billion from $ 2.4 billion . </s>
<s> At Dow Jones & Co. , third-quarter net income fell 9.9 % from the year-earlier period . </s>
<s> Net fell to $ UNK million , or 29 cents a share , from $ 32 million , or 33 cents a share . </s>
<s> The year-earlier period included a one-time gain of $ 3.5 million , or four cents a share . </s>
<s> Revenue gained 5.3 % to $ UNK million from $ UNK million . </s>
<s> The drop in profit reflected , in part , continued softness in financial advertising at The Wall Street Journal and UNK 's magazine . </s>
<s> Ad UNK at the Journal fell 6.1 % in the third quarter . </s>
<s> UNK Publications Inc. reversed a year-earlier third quarter net loss . </s>
<s> The publisher of the Boston Globe reported net of $ 8.5 million , or 12 cents a share , compared with a loss of $ UNK million , or 38 cents a share , for the third quarter in 1988 . </s>
<s> William O. Taylor , the parent 's chairman and chief executive officer , said earnings continued to be hurt by softness in ad volume at the Boston newspaper . </s>
<s> Third-quarter profit estimates for several companies are being strongly affected by the price of newsprint , which in the last two years has had several price increases . </s>
<s> After a supply crunch caused prices to rise 14 % since 1986 to $ 650 a metric ton , analysts are encouraged , because they do n't expect a price increase for the rest of this year . </s>
<s> Companies with daily newspapers in the Northeast will need the stable newsprint prices to ease damage from weak ad UNK . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK at Salomon Brothers said he estimates that Times UNK Co. 's earnings were down for the third quarter , because of soft advertising levels at its Long Island UNK and Hartford UNK newspapers . </s>
<s> UNK on the East Coast was likely offset by improved ad UNK at the Los Angeles Times , which this week also unveiled a UNK . </s>
<s> New York Times Co. is expected to report lower earnings for the third quarter because of continued weak advertising levels at its flagship New York Times and deep discounting of newsprint at its affiliate , Forest Products Group . </s>
<s> `` Times Co. 's regional daily newspapers are holding up well , but there is little sign that things will improve in the New York market , '' said Alan UNK , an analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton . </s>
<s> Washington Post Co. is expected to report improved earnings , largely because of increased cable revenue and publishing revenue helped by an improved retail market in the Washington area . </s>
<s> According to analysts , profits were also helped by successful cost-cutting measures at Newsweek . </s>

<s> UNK currently has approximately UNK million common shares outstanding . </s>
<s> Do n't jump yet . </s>
<s> The stock market 's UNK may turn out to be good news for the economy . </s>
<s> In one wild hour of trading , the market managed to accomplish what the Bush administration has been trying to do , unsuccessfully , for weeks . </s>
<s> It is forcing the Federal Reserve to ease its grip on credit and it took the wind out of a previously UNK dollar . </s>
<s> The resulting decline in interest rates and the value of the dollar could UNK American business -- indeed , the entire economy . </s>
<s> This may sound UNK optimistic . </s>
<s> After all , until a few years ago , the stock market was viewed as a barometer of the national economy . </s>
<s> When it went down , by all tradition , the economy followed . </s>
<s> That has changed , partly because the two years following the worst stock-market plunge in history have been reasonably comfortable . </s>
<s> The 1987 crash was `` a false alarm however you view it , '' says University of Chicago economist Victor UNK . </s>
<s> The market seems increasingly UNK from the rest of the nation . </s>
<s> Its UNK ca n't be UNK to fundamental business conditions , nor do they appear to UNK major UNK in the economy . </s>
<s> `` The market today has a life of its own , '' John UNK , chairman of International Business Machines Corp. , said Saturday . </s>
<s> `` There 's nothing rational about this kind of action . '' </s>
<s> Of course , the health of the economy will be threatened if the market continues to dive this week . </s>
<s> UNK falling stock prices do reduce consumer wealth , damage business confidence and discourage the foreign investors upon whom the U.S. now relies for financial UNK . </s>
<s> The financial-services industry was battered by the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> What 's more , although the stock market is far less UNK today than two years ago , the U.S. economy is weaker . </s>
<s> Growth is slower . </s>
<s> Profits are softer . </s>
<s> UNK burdens are heavier . </s>
<s> But if the stock market does n't continue to UNK , the beneficial effects of lower interest rates and a lower dollar may well dominate . </s>
<s> The Fed , which until Friday had been UNK moves to ease credit , is now UNK to UNK money into the economy if needed to UNK the markets . </s>
<s> Fed officials may protest that this does n't necessarily mean a fundamental change in their interest-rate policies . </s>
<s> But the experience of the 1987 crash suggests the Fed is likely to bring down short-term interest rates in its effort to UNK markets . </s>
<s> UNK the Fed 's move , money traders lowered a key interest rate known as the Federal Funds rate to UNK % late Friday , down from UNK % the day before . </s>
<s> UNK movements in the rate , which is what banks charge each other for overnight loans , are usually among the few visible tracks that the Fed leaves on the monetary markets . </s>
<s> The dollar also began to decline Friday as the stock market 's plunge caused some investors to UNK their desire to invest in the U.S. . </s>
<s> Treasury officials have been arguing for months that the dollar 's strength was out of UNK with economic fundamentals , threatening to UNK the export boom that has sustained manufacturers for several years . </s>
<s> The market drop has now apparently convinced foreign investors that the Treasury was right about the UNK dollar . </s>
<s> A modest drop in the dollar -- only a modest one , mind you -- would be welcomed by the U.S. . </s>
<s> That was n't the case in 1987 , when the dollar was so weak that some economists and government officials seriously worried that it might collapse , producing panic among foreign investors and UNK the flow of foreign capital to the U.S. . </s>
<s> Another big difference between 1987 and 1989 is n't so UNK . </s>
<s> In the third quarter of 1987 , the economy UNK at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 5.3 % . </s>
<s> The consensus among economists is that it grew a much more sluggish 2.3 % in the third quarter of 1989 , which ended two weeks ago . </s>
<s> The plunge in stock prices `` is happening at a time when the economy has already slowed down , '' says economist Lawrence UNK of UNK Group , a UNK UNK , Pa. , forecasting company . </s>
<s> `` A lot of UNK demand is gone . '' </s>
<s> Consumer spending did drop in the months following Black Monday 1987 -- `` but only slightly and for a short period of time , '' recalls Mr. UNK , a longtime student of business cycles . </s>
<s> `` That was offset by strength elsewhere . </s>
<s> { The effects } were much less severe and less prolonged than some had feared or expected . </s>
<s> '' Today , he UNK , exports and business investment spending may be insufficient to pick up the slack if stock prices UNK this week and if consumers UNK in reaction . </s>
<s> What 's more , the corporate borrowing UNK has n't UNK in the past two years . </s>
<s> `` We 've had two more years of significant UNK of debt ... just at the time when earnings are being squeezed , '' Mr. UNK notes . </s>
<s> The more a company relies on borrowed money , the greater its UNK to an economic slowdown . </s>
<s> A company with a strong balance sheet can withstand an unanticipated storm ; a highly leveraged company may end up in bankruptcy court . </s>
<s> The Fed , of course , knows that very well -- hence its UNK to pump credit into the economy this morning . </s>
<s> But , in the process , the Fed risks UNK inflation . </s>
<s> Even before Friday 's events , Harvard University economist Benjamin UNK was arguing that the Fed wo n't be able to live up to its tough words on eliminating inflation because of its responsibility to protect fragile financial markets , banks and highly leveraged corporations . </s>
<s> The biggest threat on the economic horizon right now is n't recession , he reasons ; it 's an UNK of UNK inflation . </s>
<s> In the end , the 1987 collapse suggested , the economy does n't move in UNK with stock prices . </s>
<s> The economy does , however , depend on the confidence of businesses , consumers and foreign investors . </s>
<s> A panic on Wall Street does n't exactly UNK confidence . </s>
<s> UNK suggested that consumer confidence was high before Friday . </s>
<s> A 190-point drop is n't likely to make much of a UNK ; UNK that a few times over , though , and it will . </s>
<s> If the reactions of executives gathered Saturday at UNK Springs , Va. , for the Business Council meetings are typical , business leaders were n't overly UNK by Friday 's decline . </s>
<s> And if foreign investors become a UNK more cautious -- well , the dollar 's recent strength suggests that the U.S. can stand it . </s>
<s> On the bottom line , the most UNK fact for the economic outlook is that we 've been through this before . </s>
<s> Two years ago , about the only point of comparison was the 1929 crash and the subsequent UNK . </s>
<s> The UNK had a UNK audience . </s>
<s> The prosperity that followed Black Monday permits a more optimistic view today . </s>
<s> At the very least , the establishment here is taking comfort from the nation 's success in handling the last UNK . </s>
<s> As Sen. Lloyd UNK ( D. , Texas ) observed yesterday , `` The Fed avoided a UNK last time . </s>
<s> They are more sophisticated this time . </s>
<s> The chemical industry is expected to report that profits eroded in the third quarter because of UNK prices in the commodity end of the business . </s>
<s> Producers of commodity chemicals , the basic chemicals produced in huge volumes for other manufacturers , have seen sharp inventory cutting by buyers . </s>
<s> Once the chief beneficiaries of the industry 's now UNK boom , these producers also will be reporting against UNK strong performances in the 1988 third quarter . </s>
<s> `` For some of these companies , this will be the first quarter with UNK negative comparisons , '' says Leonard UNK , a chemical industry analyst at Prudential UNK Research . </s>
<s> `` This could be the first of five or six down quarters . '' </s>
<s> Perhaps most prominent , Dow Chemical Co. , which as of UNK had UNK up eight consecutive record quarters , is expected to report that profit decreased in the latest quarter from a year earlier , if only by a UNK . </s>
<s> Though Dow has aggressively diversified into specialty chemicals and pharmaceuticals , the company still has a big stake in polyethylene , which is used in packaging and UNK . </s>
<s> Analysts ' third-quarter estimates for the Midland , Mich. , company are between $ UNK a share and $ UNK a share , compared with $ UNK a year ago , when profit was $ UNK million on sales of $ UNK billion . </s>
<s> A Dow spokeswoman declined to comment on the estimates . </s>
<s> At the investment firm of Smith Barney , Harris Upham & Co. , the UNK segment is seen pulling down overall profit for 20 companies representative of the whole industry by 8 % to 10 % . </s>
<s> `` You will find the commodities off more than the others and the diversified companies about even or slightly better , '' says James Wilbur , a Smith Barney analyst . </s>
<s> First Boston Corp. projects that 10 of the 15 companies it follows will report lower profit . </s>
<s> Most of the 10 have big UNK operations . </s>
<s> Still , some industry giants are expected to report continuing gains , largely because so much of their business is outside commodity chemicals . </s>
<s> Du Pont Co. is thought to have had steady profit growth in white UNK , fibers and UNK . </s>
<s> Moreover , the Wilmington , Del. , company is helped when prices weaken on the commodity chemicals it buys for its own production needs , such as UNK . </s>
<s> Analysts are divided over whether Du Pont will report much of a gain in the latest quarter from its UNK Inc. oil company . </s>
<s> The estimates for Du Pont range from $ 2.25 to $ UNK a share . </s>
<s> In the 1988 third quarter , the company earned $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share , on sales of $ UNK billion . </s>
<s> Du Pont declined to comment . </s>
<s> Monsanto Co. , too , is expected to continue reporting higher profit , even though its sales of crop chemicals were hurt in the latest quarter by drought in northern Europe and the western U.S. . </s>
<s> The St. UNK company is expected to report again that losses in its UNK Searle & Co. pharmaceutical business are narrowing . </s>
<s> Searle continued to operate in the red through the first half of the year , but Monsanto has said it expects Searle to post a profit for all of 1989 . </s>
<s> Most estimates for Monsanto run between $ UNK and $ 2 a share . </s>
<s> A year ago , the company posted third-quarter profit of $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share , on sales of $ UNK billion . </s>
<s> Monsanto declined to comment . </s>
<s> But the UNK producers are caught on the downside of a pricing cycle . </s>
<s> By some accounts on Wall Street and in the industry , the inventory reductions are near an end , which may UNK firmer demand . </s>
<s> But UNK say growing production capacity could keep pressure on prices into the early 1990s . </s>
<s> In the latest quarter , at least , profit is expected to fall sharply . </s>
<s> For UNK Inc. , `` how far down it is , we do n't know , '' says UNK UNK at Salomon Brothers . </s>
<s> The projections are in the neighborhood of 50 cents a share to 75 cents , compared with a restated $ 1.65 a share a year earlier , when profit was $ UNK million on sales of $ UNK million . </s>
<s> UNK faces lower prices for its mainstay product , UNK , while it goes forward with a heavy capital investment program to bolster its raw material supply and develop new uses for UNK , whose markets include the packaging and automobile industries . </s>
<s> The company , based in Wilmington , Del. , is UNK by Montedison S.p . A. , Milan , which has an offer outstanding for the UNK shares it does n't already own . </s>
<s> At Quantum Chemical Corp. , New York , the trouble is lower prices for polyethylene , higher debt costs and the UNK of an important plant due to an explosion . </s>
<s> Some analysts hedge their estimates for Quantum , because it is n't known when the company will book certain one-time charges . </s>
<s> But the estimates range from UNK to 35 cents a share . </s>
<s> In the 1988 third quarter , Quantum earned $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share , on sales of $ UNK million . </s>
<s> Another big polyethylene producer , Union Carbide Corp. , is expected to post profit of between $ 1 a share and $ 1.25 , compared with $ UNK a share a year earlier , when the company earned $ UNK million on sales of $ UNK billion . </s>

<s> Most of the complaints about UNK phone calls came from regional brokers rather than individual investors . </s>
<s> Mr. King of UNK and others were quick to add that they believe the problem stemmed more from traders ' inability to handle the volume of calls , rather than a UNK attempt to avoid making trades . </s>
<s> The subject is a UNK one for Nasdaq and its UNK companies , which were widely criticized two years ago following complaints from investors who could n't reach their brokers or trade in the chaos of the crash . </s>
<s> Peter UNK , head of retail equity trading at Shearson Lehman Hutton , declared : `` It was the last hour of trading on a Friday . </s>

<s> But , he added , `` you can only take one call at a time . '' </s>
<s> Market makers keep supplies of stock on hand to maintain UNK trading when imbalances occur . </s>
<s> On days like Friday , that means they must buy shares from sellers when no one else is willing to . </s>
<s> When selling is so UNK , prices fall UNK and fast . </s>
<s> Two years ago , faced with the possibility of heavy losses on the stocks in their inventories , market makers themselves began UNK shares , UNK the slide in OTC stock prices . </s>

<s> So , while OTC companies incurred losses on Friday , trading officials said the damage was n't as bad as it was in 1987 . </s>
<s> `` Two years ago we were carrying huge inventories and that was the big UNK . </s>

<s> The oil industry 's UNK profits could UNK through the rest of the year . </s>
<s> Major oil companies in the next few days are expected to report much less robust earnings than they did for the third quarter a year ago , largely reflecting deteriorating chemical prices and gasoline profitability . </s>
<s> The gasoline picture may improve this quarter , but chemicals are likely to remain weak , industry executives and analysts say , reducing chances that profits could equal their year-earlier performance . </s>
<s> The industry is `` seeing a softening somewhat in volume and certainly in price in petrochemicals , '' Glenn UNK , president of Phillips Petroleum Co. , said in an interview . </s>
<s> `` That change will obviously impact third and fourth quarter earnings '' for the industry in general , he added . </s>
<s> He did n't forecast Phillips 's results . </s>
<s> But securities analysts say Phillips will be among the companies UNK by weak chemical prices and will probably post a drop in third-quarter earnings . </s>
<s> So , too , many analysts predict , will Exxon Corp. , Chevron Corp. and Amoco Corp . </s>
<s> Typical is what happened to the price of UNK , a major commodity chemical produced in vast amounts by many oil companies . </s>
<s> It has plunged 13 % since July to around 26 cents a pound . </s>
<s> A year ago UNK sold for 33 cents , UNK at about 34 cents last December . </s>
<s> A big reason for the chemical price retreat is UNK . </s>
<s> UNK in UNK , prices began accelerating as a growing U.S. economy and the weak dollar spurred demand . </s>
<s> Companies added capacity UNK . </s>
<s> Now , greatly increased supplies are on the market , while the dollar is stronger , and domestic economic growth is slower . </s>
<s> Third-quarter profits from gasoline were weaker . </s>
<s> `` UNK margins were so good in the third quarter of last year and generally not very good this year , '' said William UNK , a securities analyst at First Boston Corp . </s>
<s> Oil company UNK ran flat out to prepare for a robust holiday driving season in July and August that did n't UNK . </s>
<s> The excess supply pushed gasoline prices down in that period . </s>
<s> In addition , crude oil prices were up some from a year earlier , further UNK profitability . </s>
<s> UNK say margins picked up in September , and many industry officials believe gasoline profits will rebound this quarter , though still not to the level of 1988 's fourth quarter . </s>
<s> During the 1988 second half , many companies posted record gasoline and chemical profits . </s>
<s> Crude oil production may turn out to be the most surprising element of companies ' earnings this year . </s>
<s> Prices -- averaging roughly $ 2 a barrel higher in the third quarter than a year earlier -- have stayed well above most companies ' expectations . </s>
<s> Demand has been much stronger than anticipated , and it typically UNK in the fourth quarter . </s>
<s> `` We could see higher oil prices this year , '' said UNK UNK , an analyst at PaineWebber Inc . </s>
<s> That will translate into sharply higher production profits , particularly compared with last year when oil prices steadily fell to below $ 13 a barrel in the fourth quarter . </s>
<s> While oil prices have been better than expected , natural gas prices have been worse . </s>
<s> In the third quarter , they averaged about 5 % less than they were in 1988 . </s>
<s> The main reason remains weather . </s>
<s> Last summer was UNK for a heat wave and drought that caused utilities to UNK more natural gas to feed increased electrical demand from air UNK use . </s>
<s> This summer , on the other hand , had UNK weather than usual . </s>
<s> `` We 've been very disappointed in the performance of natural gas prices , '' said Mr. UNK , Phillips 's president . </s>
<s> `` The lagging gas price is not going to assist fourth quarter performance as many had expected . '' </s>
<s> UNK into the fourth quarter , natural gas prices are anywhere from 8 % to 17 % lower than a year earlier . </s>
<s> For instance , natural gas currently produced along the Gulf Coast is selling on the spot market for around $ UNK a thousand cubic feet , down 13 % from $ UNK a thousand cubic feet a year ago . </s>

<s> UNK tried to finger each other for the blame , although many analysts doubt that Washington was UNK responsible for Wall Street 's woes . </s>
<s> But Mr. UNK 's comments make one thing clear : Some on Wall Street wonder if anyone is in charge of economic policy . </s>
<s> Consider this : </s>
<s> -- By UNK p.m. tonight , President Bush must order $ 16 billion of automatic , across-the-board cuts in government spending to comply with the Gramm-Rudman budget law . </s>
<s> The cuts are necessary because Congress and the administration have failed to reach agreement on a UNK bill . </s>
<s> `` We simply do n't have strong leadership to try to reduce the deficit and make tough choices , '' House Budget Committee Chairman UNK UNK ( D. , Calif . ) said yesterday on NBC News 's `` UNK the Press . '' </s>
<s> -- For the last two weeks , the Bush administration and the Federal Reserve have been engaged in a UNK battle over international economic policy . </s>
<s> The administration has been trying to push the dollar lower ; the Fed has been UNK . </s>
<s> `` One of the things that continues to worry me is this monetary UNK between the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve Board , '' said Lawrence UNK , a Bear , Stearns & Co. economist , on ABC 's `` This UNK . '' </s>
<s> -- The administration has sent out confusing signals about its response to a recent UNK of airline takeovers . </s>
<s> Last month , Transportation Secretary Sam Skinner forced Northwest Airlines to reduce a stake held by UNK Royal Dutch Airlines . </s>
<s> But he has since run into opposition from the Treasury and the White House over that decision . </s>
<s> And he has kept UNK on how his decision might affect a bid for United Airlines , which includes a big stake by British Airways PLC . </s>
<s> Some analysts say uncertainty about Washington 's anti-takeover policy was one reason that financing for the United Airlines takeover fell through -- the event that triggered the market drop . </s>
<s> In many ways , the UNK to Friday 's stock decline is UNK similar to that of October 1987 's UNK crash . </s>
<s> Then , as now , the budget debate was behind schedule and automatic spending cuts were within days of taking hold . </s>
<s> The Treasury was locked in a battle over international economic policy , although at that time it was with West German officials rather than the Federal Reserve . </s>
<s> And concern about official actions aimed at takeovers -- then by the UNK House Ways and Means Committee rather than the Transportation Department -- were making markets nervous . </s>
<s> The 1987 crash brought the Reagan administration and Democratic lawmakers to the table for the first budget summit , resulting in a two-year plan to reduce the deficit by more than $ 76 billion -- even though the deficit actually rose by nearly $ 12 billion during that period . </s>
<s> But , barring further drops in the market this week , a similar outcome does n't seem likely this year . </s>
<s> Lawmakers and administration officials agree that Friday 's drop , by itself , is n't enough to force both sides back to the table to try to reach a deficit-reduction agreement that would be more serious and more far-reaching than last spring 's UNK plan , which still is n't fully implemented . </s>
<s> One of the biggest reasons that new talks are n't likely to come about is that , as everyone learned in 1987 , the economy and the market can survive a one-day UNK tumble . </s>
<s> `` Everybody thought we were looking at a UNK of 1929 , that we were looking at a recession , '' Rep. UNK said yesterday in an interview . </s>
<s> `` That did not happen . </s>
<s> They learned they could survive it without much problem . '' </s>
<s> But administration officials privately agree with Mr. UNK , who said a UNK drop this week `` is going to force the president and Congress to take a much harder look at fiscal policy . '' </s>
<s> In that case , there will be plenty of blame to go around . </s>
<s> `` There is an underlying concern on the part of the American people -- and there should be - that the administration has not gone far enough in cutting this deficit and that Congress has been unwilling to cut what the administration asked us to cut , '' said Senate Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd UNK ( D. , Texas ) . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , it clearly will take more than Friday 's 190-point decline to overcome the bitter feelings that have developed between lawmakers and White House Budget Director Richard Darman over the capital-gains fight . </s>
<s> Hill Democrats are particularly angry over Mr. Bush 's claim that the capital-gains cut was part of April 's budget accord and his insistence on combining it with the deficit-reduction legislation . </s>
<s> `` There is no prospect of any so-called grand compromise or deal next year because the administration simply did n't live up to this year 's deal , '' Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell ( D. , Maine ) said yesterday on CBS News 's `` UNK the UNK . '' </s>
<s> During last week 's UNK on the UNK bill and the capital-gains issue , there were signs that Senate Republicans and the administration were at odds . </s>
<s> At the very moment that Senate Republicans were negotiating a deal to exclude capital gains from the deficit-reduction legislation , White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater told reporters that it was the president 's policy to include it . </s>
<s> When an agreement was reached to strip capital gains from the legislation , Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood , the ranking GOP member of the UNK Senate Finance Committee , hailed it . </s>
<s> Asked if the administration agreed , he UNK replied : `` The UNK will have to speak for itself . '' </s>
<s> Friday 's market tumble could spur action on UNK the House and Senate versions of the deficit-reduction measure , a process that is n't expected to begin until tomorrow at the UNK . </s>
<s> Senate Republicans expressed the hope that the House would follow the lead of the Senate , which on Friday agreed to drop a variety of spending measures and tax breaks that would have increased the fiscal 1990 deficit . </s>
<s> `` The market needs a strong signal that we 're serious about deficit reduction , and the best way to do that is for the House of Representatives to strip their bill '' of similar provisions , Sen. Warren UNK ( R. , UNK . ) . said yesterday . </s>
<s> The White House Office of Management and Budget , whose calculations determine whether the Gramm-Rudman targets are met , estimated that the House-passed deficit-reduction measure would cut the fiscal 1990 UNK by $ 6.2 billion , almost half of the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of $ UNK billion . </s>
<s> Rep. UNK said that UNK 's figure would still be enough to avoid permanent across-the-board cuts , but added : `` We 're getting very close to the margins here . '' </s>
<s> No one in Washington was willing to take the blame for UNK Friday 's drop in the stock market . </s>
<s> But some players were quick to seize the moment . </s>
<s> Before the sun had set on Friday , Richard UNK , the UNK chief economist of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce , issued a statement UNK the drop in stock prices to the Senate decision to postpone action on capital gains . </s>
<s> `` Investors , who had been holding assets in anticipation of a more favorable time to sell , were UNK , '' he said . </s>
<s> `` There have been many UNK reasons advanced to support a capital-gains tax cut , '' Sen. Mitchell said during his television appearance , `` but I suggest that is perhaps more than any of the others . </s>
<s> The crowded field for UNK computers is about to become a lot more crowded . </s>
<s> Compaq Computer Corp. 's long-awaited entry today into the notebook field is expected to put immediate heat on others in the market , especially UNK Electronics Corp. , the current market leader , and on a UNK of promising UNK . </s>
<s> Compaq 's series of UNK UNK a trend toward UNK in the personal computer market . </s>
<s> One manufacturer already has produced a UNK computer called a UNK , and two others have introduced even smaller `` UNK . '' </s>
<s> But those machines are still considered UNK , with UNK only a UNK could love and screens to match . </s>
<s> Compaq 's UNK , by contrast , may be the first in their weight class not to UNK on features found in much bigger machines . </s>
<s> Analysts say they 're faster and carry more memory than anything else of their size on the market -- and they 're priced aggressively at $ UNK to $ 5,000 . </s>
<s> All of this comes in a machine that UNK only six pounds and fits UNK into most UNK . </s>
<s> In recent months , Compaq 's competition , including UNK , Toshiba Corp. , Tandy Corp. and NEC Corp. all have introduced UNK that weigh approximately the same and that are called UNK -- perhaps UNK . </s>
<s> One analyst , noting that most such machines are about two inches thick , takes exception to the name . </s>
<s> `` This is n't quite a notebook -- I call it a UNK , '' he says . </s>
<s> That ca n't be said of the $ UNK UNK computer introduced a few weeks ago by UNK Systems Corp. , a unit of Tandy . </s>
<s> Instead of a UNK , it features a writing surface , an electronic UNK and the ability to `` read '' block printing . </s>
<s> At 4 1\/2 pounds , it may be too UNK named , but it nevertheless opens up the kind of marketing possibilities that make analysts UNK . </s>
<s> UNK are n't far behind . </s>
<s> UNK Corp. 's Portfolio , introduced in Europe two months ago and in the U.S. in early September , UNK less than a pound , costs a mere $ 400 and runs on three UNK UNK , yet has the power to run some UNK and word processing programs . </s>
<s> Some critics , however , say its ability to run UNK programs is restricted by a limited memory . </s>
<s> UNK Computer Corp. , meanwhile , has introduced a much more sophisticated UNK that can run Lotus UNK and other sophisticated software programs , but costs five times as much . </s>
<s> At stake is what Mike UNK , Compaq 's president of North America operations , calls `` the UNK UNK of the computer industry '' -- the search for `` a real computer in a package so small you can take it everywhere . '' </s>
<s> The market is so new , nobody knows yet how big it can be . </s>
<s> `` I 've had a lot of people trying to sell me services to find out how big it is , '' says Tom UNK , director of marketing for UNK . </s>
<s> `` Whether it 's $ 5 billion or $ 3.5 billion , it does n't matter . </s>
<s> It 's huge . '' </s>
<s> Consider the growth of UNK , which now UNK 12 % of all personal computer sales . </s>
<s> UNK -- generally anything under 15 pounds -- have become the fastest-growing personal computer segment , with sales doubling this year . </s>
<s> UNK to that demand , however , has led to a variety of UNK . </s>
<s> UNK computers smaller often means UNK memory . </s>
<s> It also has UNK use of the faster , more powerful UNK found in increasing numbers of desktop machines . </s>
<s> UNK and weight considerations also have limited screen displays . </s>
<s> The competitive UNK can get pretty UNK at times . </s>
<s> A UNK spokesman , for example , UNK the UNK Portfolio because it requires three UNK while the UNK needs only two . </s>
<s> Both UNK are dismissed by notebook makers , who argue that they 're too small -- a problem UNK also encountered in focus groups , admits UNK UNK , director of marketing . </s>
<s> UNK , trying to avoid the `` UNK '' label , responded with the UNK line , `` The UNK PC -- a UNK Big Computer . '' </s>
<s> Despite the UNK , few question the UNK of the move to small machines that do n't make UNK . </s>
<s> UNK that end , experts say the real battle will take place between UNK players like Toshiba , UNK and now Compaq . </s>
<s> Compaq 's new machines are considered a direct threat to start-up firms like UNK Inc. , which introduced in June a computer that , like Compaq 's , uses an Intel UNK microprocessor and has a hard disk drive . </s>
<s> But the UNK product is twice as heavy and costs more than Compaq 's . </s>
<s> Compaq 's announcement also UNK trouble for UNK , which last year had 28 % of the U.S. laptop market but recently agreed to sell its computer business to UNK des Machines UNK , the French government-owned computer maker . </s>
<s> UNK holders will vote in December on the proposed $ UNK million sale , a price that could slip because it is pegged to UNK 's share and sales . </s>
<s> Compaq is already taking aim at UNK 's market share . </s>
<s> UNK UNK , Compaq 's president and chief executive officer , notes UNK that UNK 's $ 2,000 UNK uses an `` UNK '' UNK UNK disk , UNK Compaq 's new machines use the more common 3 1 / UNK disk . </s>
<s> John P. Frank , president of UNK Data Systems , simply UNK off such criticism , noting that 3 1 / UNK UNK were also `` UNK '' when they first replaced UNK disks . </s>
<s> `` We do n't look at it as not being a standard , we look at it as a new standard , '' he argues . </s>
<s> Analysts do n't see it that way . </s>
<s> `` I ca n't imagine that you 'll talk to anyone who wo n't tell you this is UNK for Compaq and a UNK for everyone else , '' says UNK UNK , president of Professional Marketing Management Inc . </s>
<s> Adds Bill UNK , senior industry analyst for UNK , a high-technology market research firm : `` We basically think that these are very hot products . </s>
<s> The problem Compaq is going to have is that they wo n't be able to make enough of them . '' </s>
<s> Compaq 's machines include the 3 1 / UNK UNK disk drive , a UNK screen that is only 1 / UNK thick and an internal expansion UNK for a UNK -- in other words , almost all the UNK of a typical office machine . </s>
<s> Others UNK will follow , but most analysts believe Compaq has at least a six-month lead on the competition . </s>
<s> Toshiba 's line of UNK , for example , features the UNK , which is in the same weight class but is much slower and has less memory , and the UNK , which also uses a UNK microprocessor , but which UNK almost twice as much and is three times the size . </s>
<s> A third model , marketed in Japan , may hit the U.S. by the end of the first quarter of 1990 , but by then , analysts say , Compaq will have established itself as one of three major players . </s>

<s> That 's not a bad way to proceed , just somewhat different from standard American practice . </s>
<s> How was that practice referred to when I was in school ? </s>
<s> UNK , yes , something called a Star Chamber . </s>
<s> Of course , Mr. UNK UNK protest that his subcommittee simply seeks information for legislative change . </s>
<s> No doubt that 's partially true . </s>
<s> Everything that Mr. UNK says in his letter is partially true . </s>

<s> No , to my mind , the Journal did not `` defend UNK , fraud , waste , UNK , UNK and abuse of the public trust ... '' </s>
<s> it defended appropriate constitutional UNK and practical common sense . </s>
<s> The problem , which the Journal so UNK pointed out in a number of articles , is not the likes of Mr. UNK , who after all is really a bit player on the stage , but the attempt by Congress to enhance itself into a UNK / judicial body . </s>
<s> ( Of course , we 've also got a UNK that seeks the same objective . ) </s>
<s> The system is the problem , not an individual member . </s>
<s> Individuals can always have their hands UNK . </s>
<s> It 's when such UNK does n't occur that we 've got trouble . </s>
<s> I do not by any means defend HUD management . </s>
<s> But I think the kind of congressional investigation that has been pursued is a far greater danger to American UNK of UNK and freedom than any UNK ( and , yes , maybe UNK ) within HUD could possibly generate . </s>

<s> I disagree with the statement by Mr. UNK that one should not draw an adverse UNK against former HUD officials who UNK their Fifth Amendment privilege against UNK in congressional hearings . </s>
<s> The Fifth Amendment states in relevant part that no person `` shall be UNK , in any criminal case , to be a witness against himself . '' </s>
<s> This privilege against UNK UNK the drawing of an adverse UNK against a criminal defendant who chooses not to testify . </s>
<s> Thus , in a criminal case , a prosecutor can not comment on a defendant 's failure to testify nor can the defendant be UNK to take the stand as a witness , thus forcing him to `` take the Fifth . '' </s>
<s> The privilege , however , has been limited in UNK with its plain language to protect the defendant in criminal matters only . </s>
<s> The Supreme Court and some states have specifically recognized that `` the Fifth Amendment does not preclude the UNK where the privilege is claimed by a party to a civil cause . '' </s>
<s> UNK v. UNK , UNK U.S. UNK ( 1976 ) . </s>
<s> Thus , in a civil case , a defendant may be called as a witness , he may be forced to testify or take the Fifth , and his taking of the Fifth may permit the drawing of an adverse UNK against him in the civil matter . </s>
<s> He may take the Fifth in a civil matter only if he has a good faith and UNK belief that his testimony may subject him to criminal prosecution . </s>
<s> UNK the defendant to take the Fifth in a civil matter is not based on a constitutional right to refuse to testify where one 's testimony UNK him in the civil matter , but because the testimony in the civil matter could be UNK used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . </s>
<s> UNK the risk of such prosecution , a court may order the defendant to testify . </s>
<s> Thus , when Mr. UNK asserted the Fifth in a UNK proceeding , particularly after UNK receiving extensive advice from legal counsel , one must conclude that he held a UNK , UNK belief that his testimony could be used against him in a subsequent criminal prosecution . </s>
<s> The subcommittee , Congress and the American public have every right to draw the adverse UNK and to UNK with Mr. UNK 's own belief that his testimony could help UNK him of a crime . </s>
<s> UNK the adverse UNK in a UNK congressional hearing does not UNK the Fifth Amendment shield against UNK . </s>

<s> The Senate 's decision to approve a UNK deficit-reduction bill without a capital-gains tax cut still leaves open the possibility of UNK a gains tax reduction this year . </s>
<s> Late Friday night , the Senate voted UNK to approve an estimated $ 13.5 billion measure that had been stripped of hundreds of provisions that would have widened , rather than narrowed , the federal budget deficit . </s>
<s> Lawmakers drastically UNK the bill to UNK criticism that it was UNK with UNK tax breaks and spending increases . </s>
<s> `` We 're putting a deficit-reduction bill back in the category of being a deficit-reduction bill , '' said Senate Budget Committee Chairman James UNK ( D. , UNK . ) . </s>
<s> But Senate supporters of the UNK legislation said that other bills would soon be moving through Congress that could carry some of the measures that had been cast aside , including a capital-gains tax cut . </s>
<s> In addition , the companion deficit-reduction bill already passed by the House includes a capital-gains provision . </s>
<s> House-Senate negotiations are likely to begin at UNK and last for a while . </s>
<s> `` No one can predict exactly what will happen on the House side , '' said Senate UNK Leader Robert Dole ( R. , UNK . ) . </s>
<s> But , he added , `` I believe Republicans and Democrats will work together to get capital-gains reform this year . '' </s>

<s> House Budget Committee Chairman UNK UNK ( D. , Calif . ) said in an interview , `` If that 's the signal that comes from the White House , that will help a great deal . '' </s>

<s> One obvious place to UNK a capital-gains tax cut , and perhaps other popular items stripped from the deficit-reduction bill , is the legislation to raise the federal borrowing limit . </s>
<s> Such legislation must be enacted by the end of the month . </s>
<s> The Senate bill was UNK back in an attempt to speed deficit-reduction through Congress . </s>
<s> Because the legislation has n't been completed , President Bush has until midnight tonight to enact across-the-board spending cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law . </s>
<s> Senators hope that the need to avoid those cuts will pressure the House to agree to the UNK bill . </s>
<s> The House appears reluctant to join the senators . </s>
<s> A key is whether House Republicans are willing to UNK to their Senate colleagues ' decision to drop many pet provisions . </s>
<s> `` Although I am encouraged by the Senate action , '' said Chairman Dan UNK ( D. , Ill . ) of the House Ways and Means Committee , `` it is uncertain whether a clean bill can be achieved in the UNK conference with the Senate . '' </s>
<s> Another big question UNK over the debate is what President Bush thinks . </s>
<s> He has been UNK a UNK bill without a guaranteed vote on his capital-gains tax cut . </s>
<s> But Republican senators saw no way to overcome a procedural UNK and UNK the 60 votes needed to win the capital-gains issue on the floor , so they went ahead with the UNK bill . </s>
<s> The Senate bill was stripped of many popular , though UNK , provisions , a number of which are included in the House-passed bill . </s>
<s> These include a UNK initiative and UNK of UNK tax breaks for low-income housing and UNK expenditures . </s>
<s> Also missing from the Senate bill is the House 's repeal of a law , called Section 89 , that UNK companies to give UNK workers comparable health benefits to top paid executives . </s>
<s> One UNK provision that was originally in the Senate bill but was cut out because it lost money was the proposal by Chairman Lloyd UNK ( D. , Texas ) of the Senate Finance Committee to expand the deduction for individual retirement accounts . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK said he hopes the Senate will consider that measure soon . </s>
<s> To the UNK of some doctors , the bill dropped a plan passed by the Finance Committee that would have UNK the entire UNK system under Medicare . </s>
<s> To the UNK of many low-income people , efforts to boost Medicaid funding , especially in rural areas , also were UNK . </s>
<s> Asked why senators were giving up so much , New Mexico Sen. UNK UNK , the ranking Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , said , `` We 're looking like UNK . </s>
<s> UNK had just gone too far . '' </s>
<s> Sen. Dole said that the move required sacrifice by every senator . </s>
<s> It worked , others said , because there were no exceptions : all UNK provisions were UNK . </s>
<s> The Senate also dropped a plan by its Finance Committee that would have increased the income UNK beyond which senior citizens have their Social Security benefits reduced . </s>
<s> In addition , the bill dropped a plan to make permanent a 3 % UNK tax on long-distance telephone calls . </s>
<s> It no longer includes a plan that would have UNK what remains of the UNK method of accounting , which is used by military contractors to reduce their tax burden . </s>
<s> It also drops a provision that would have permitted corporations to use excess pension funds to pay health benefits for current UNK . </s>
<s> Also UNK was a UNK increase in the maximum UNK Safety and Health Administration penalties , which would have raised $ 65 million in fiscal 1990 . </s>
<s> A provision that would have made the Social Security Administration an independent agency was UNK . </s>
<s> The approval of the Senate bill was especially sweet for Sen. Mitchell , who had proposed the streamlining . </s>
<s> Mr. Mitchell 's relations with Budget Director Darman , who pushed for a capital-gains cut to be added to the measure , have been UNK since Mr. Darman chose to UNK the Maine Democrat and deal with other lawmakers earlier this year during a dispute over drug funding in the fiscal 1989 UNK spending bill . </s>
<s> The deficit reduction bill contains $ 5.3 billion in tax increases in fiscal 1990 , and $ 26 billion over five years . </s>
<s> The UNK provisions , which affect mostly corporations , would : </s>

<s> The balance is supplied by a host of smaller exporters , such as Australia and Venezuela . </s>
<s> The U.S. had about an extra 2 % of the domestic steel market to give to foreign suppliers in its quota talks . </s>

<s> A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant , taken private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion leveraged buy-out by UNK Kravis Roberts & Co. , confirmed that it is UNK down the RJR Nabisco UNK unit , and UNK its 14 employees , in a move to save money . </s>
<s> The spokesman said RJR is discussing its UNK plans with its two main advertising firms , UNK / UNK Katz and UNK UNK . </s>
<s> `` We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost , '' said the spokesman , who declined to specify how much RJR spends on network television time . </s>
<s> An executive close to the company said RJR is spending about $ 140 million on network television time this year , down from roughly $ 200 million last year . </s>
<s> The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be UNK Dec. 1 , and the move wo n't affect RJR 's print , radio and UNK buying practices . </s>
<s> The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago , when RJR 's previous management moved it to Atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer . </s>
<s> One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future . '' </s>
<s> He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , UNK them from jobs with advertising agencies . </s>
<s> The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' UNK season . </s>
<s> `` The studies { on closing the unit } could n't be completed until now , '' he said . </s>
<s> The group 's president , Peter UNK , was n't in his office Friday afternoon to comment . </s>
<s> While corn and soybean prices have slumped well below their UNK UNK of 1988 , wheat prices remain UNK high . </s>
<s> And they 're likely to stay that way for months to come , analysts say . </s>
<s> For one thing , even with many farmers UNK more winter wheat this year than last , tight wheat supplies are likely to support prices well into 1990 , the analysts say . </s>
<s> And if rain does n't fall soon across many of the Great UNK ' UNK areas , yields in the crop now being UNK could be reduced , further UNK supplies . </s>
<s> Also supporting prices are expectations that the Soviet Union will place substantial buying orders over the next few months . </s>
<s> By next May 31 , stocks of U.S. wheat to be carried over into the next season -- before the winter wheat now being UNK is UNK -- are projected to drop to UNK million UNK . </s>
<s> That would be the lowest level since the early 1970s . </s>
<s> Stocks were UNK million UNK on May 31 of this year . </s>
<s> In response to UNK domestic supplies , Agriculture Secretary UNK UNK last month said the U.S. government would slightly increase the number of acres farmers can plant in wheat for next year and still qualify for federal support payments . </s>
<s> The government estimates that the new plan will boost production next year by about 66 million UNK . </s>
<s> It now estimates production for next year at just under 2.6 billion UNK , compared with this year 's estimated UNK billion and a UNK UNK billion in 1988 . </s>
<s> But the full effect on prices of the winter wheat now being UNK wo n't be felt until the second half of next year . </s>
<s> Until then , limited stocks are likely to keep prices near the $ UNK level , analysts say . </s>
<s> On the Chicago Board of Trade Friday , wheat for December delivery settled at $ UNK a bushel , unchanged . </s>
<s> In theory at least , tight supplies next spring could leave the wheat futures market UNK to a UNK squeeze , said Daniel UNK , a futures analyst with UNK Co. in Chicago . </s>
<s> Such a situation can UNK UNK , as was shown by the emergency that developed in soybean futures trading this summer on the Chicago Board of Trade . </s>
<s> In July , the UNK ordered UNK UNK S.p . A. to liquidate futures positions equal to about 23 million UNK of soybeans . </s>
<s> The exchange said it feared that some members would n't be able to find enough soybeans to deliver and would have to default on their UNK obligation to the Italian conglomerate , which had refused requests to reduce its holdings . </s>
<s> UNK has denied it was trying to manipulate the soybean futures market . </s>
<s> UNK hot , dry weather across large portions of the Great UNK and in UNK areas in Washington and Oregon is threatening to reduce the yield from this season 's winter wheat crop , said UNK UNK , a futures analyst and head of UNK Analytical in Chicago . </s>
<s> For example , in the Oklahoma UNK , 40 % or more of the UNK is short of UNK . </s>
<s> That figure UNK to about 47 % in UNK portions of Kansas , he said . </s>
<s> The Soviet Union has n't given any clear indication of its wheat purchase plans , but many analysts expect Moscow to place sizable orders for U.S. wheat in the next few months , further supporting prices . </s>
<s> `` Wheat prices will increasingly UNK off of Soviet demand '' in coming weeks , predicted Richard UNK , vice president , research , for UNK Inc. in Chicago . </s>
<s> Looking ahead to other commodity markets this week : </s>
<s> Orange UNK Traders will be watching to see how long and how far the price decline that began Friday will go . </s>
<s> Late Thursday , after the close of trading , the market received what would normally have been a bullish U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of the UNK Florida UNK crop . </s>
<s> It was near the low range of estimates , at 130 million UNK boxes , compared with UNK million boxes last season . </s>
<s> However , as expected , Brazil waited for the crop estimate to come out and then cut the export price of its UNK concentrate to about $ UNK a pound from around $ 1.55 . </s>
<s> Friday 's UNK selling of futures contracts UNK whatever UNK effect the U.S. report might have had and sent the November UNK UNK contract down as much as UNK cents a pound at one time . </s>
<s> It settled with a loss of UNK cents at $ UNK a pound . </s>
<s> Brazilian UNK , after a delay caused by drought at the start of its crop season , is beginning to arrive in the U.S. in large quantities . </s>
<s> Brazil wants to stimulate demand for its product , which is going to be in UNK supply . </s>
<s> The price cut , one analyst said , appeared to be aimed even more at Europe , where consumption of Brazilian UNK has fallen . </s>
<s> It 's a UNK product , and the strong dollar has made it more expensive in Europe , the analyst said . </s>
<s> New York futures prices have dropped significantly from more than $ 2 a pound at UNK . </s>
<s> UNK a cold UNK or other crop problems in the growing areas , downward pressure on prices is likely to continue into January , when UNK and processing of UNK in Florida reach their peak , the analyst said . </s>
<s> Energy </s>
<s> Although some analysts look for profit-taking in the wake of Friday 's leap in crude oil prices , last week 's rally is generally expected to continue this week . </s>
<s> `` I would continue to look for a stable crude market , at least in futures '' trading , said William UNK , an energy futures broker with UNK & Co . </s>
<s> Friday capped a week of steadily rising crude oil prices in both futures and spot markets . </s>
<s> On the New York Mercantile Exchange , West Texas Intermediate crude for November delivery finished at $ UNK a barrel , up 42 cents on the day . </s>
<s> On European markets , meanwhile , spot prices of North Sea UNK were up 35 to 75 cents a barrel . </s>
<s> `` This market still wants to go higher , '' said UNK UNK , a first vice president at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . </s>
<s> He predicted that the November contract will reach $ UNK a barrel or more on the New York Mercantile Exchange . </s>
<s> There has been little news to account for such UNK in the oil markets . </s>
<s> Analysts generally cite a lack of bearish developments as well as rumors of a possible UNK of supplies of some fuels and UNK . </s>
<s> There also are UNK reports that the Soviet Union is having difficulties with its oil exports and that UNK has about reached its production limit and ca n't produce as much as it could sell . </s>
<s> Many traders UNK a UNK of near-term supplies , particularly of high-quality UNK such as those produced in the North Sea and in UNK . </s>
