<s> What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently UNK to handle another UNK in prices . </s>
<s> No UNK with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling . </s>
<s> But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency . </s>
<s> After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be UNK to halt trading whenever panic conditions UNK . </s>
<s> The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours . </s>
<s> The UNK is that an UNK of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , UNK sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels . </s>
<s> It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic . </s>
<s> A temporary UNK of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from UNK on itself . </s>
<s> But there is also the possibility that UNK down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices . </s>
<s> What happened Friday was the worst of all UNK . </s>
<s> The futures exchanges followed their own UNK circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p.m. for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index . </s>
<s> Options markets stopped trading in many securities . </s>
<s> The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open . </s>
<s> With UNK else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange . </s>
<s> As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply . </s>
<s> Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense . </s>
<s> At UNK , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened . </s>
<s> Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at UNK , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines . </s>
<s> At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange . </s>
<s> It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though UNK separate , have actually become so closely UNK as to constitute one market effectively . </s>
<s> Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them . </s>
<s> It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers . </s>
<s> To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none . </s>
<s> UNK circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for UNK , less volatile executions . </s>
<s> It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for UNK trading or staying open . </s>
<s> Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a UNK decline . </s>
<s> The need for UNK last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that UNK circuit breakers in all markets . </s>
<s> The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open . </s>
<s> The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies . </s>
<s> Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( which , with the SEC , UNK the Chicago stock-index markets ) be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary . </s>

<s> Even if that is so , however , it 's probably the case that no barriers should have been UNK to stop the UNK before the end of the UNK ( UNK ) . </s>
<s> The UNK began Friday afternoon when word spread that the UAL buy-out was UNK . </s>
<s> Although the UNK expects to UNK together a substitute offer , consisting of less cash , the failure to get cash from Japanese and American banks confirmed a growing fear among arbitragers that the UNK of UNK takeover deals is ending . </s>

<s> As usual , few favorable reviews were heard for that UNK UNK band of program traders , although most serious studies suggest they only play the music that others write . </s>
<s> What really UNK the UNK along Wall Street , however , was the sudden concern that , whatever the reason , the pool of debt capital is UNK up . </s>
<s> Gray Friday reflects a panic mainly by the takeover arbitragers , rather than the small investor , as their highly UNK investments in the `` deal '' stocks are UNK by the unexpected UNK up of the UNK for deal financing . </s>
<s> UNK stocks led the market down as they absorbed the heaviest losses . </s>
<s> UAL , which triggered the slide , opened Monday at $ UNK , down about 20 % from Thursday 's close . </s>
<s> AMR opened Monday at $ 80 , down nearly 20 % from Thursday 's close . </s>
<s> ( Both took further hits yesterday . ) </s>
<s> UNK lost 20 % on Friday ; Paramount lost almost 11 % . </s>
<s> A careful look UNK that where deal financing has been secured , the target 's stock price was not affected on Friday . </s>
<s> The UNK prospects , where the bidder must line up a consortium of banks and / or issue billions in high-yield debt , were where the damage was concentrated . </s>
<s> The market for so-called junk bonds has been setting the stage for Friday 's dramatic march for several weeks . </s>
<s> The growing financial difficulties of recent UNK UNK or takeovers , such as UNK International , Integrated Resources , and Campeau 's retailing empire , have cast a UNK over the entire market for high-yield securities . </s>
<s> Investors have reacted by ignoring recent efforts to float junk bonds by Ohio UNK and by forcing Ramada to postpone indefinitely its planned junk-bond sale and restructuring . </s>
<s> As a result , high-yield mutual funds have declined across the board and the many firms planning to sell $ 11 billion in junk bonds before year-end are experiencing anxious times . </s>
<s> These are all market UNK ( putting aside the UNK boosts that the tax code gives to debt over equity ) , and what we 've seen is the market UNK them in . </s>
<s> Of course , Washington had n't been silent in the days leading up to the debacle , and its tendency to UNK in the leverage UNK remains a troublesome prospect , but those preliminary steps should n't UNK us from the basic market UNK that was at work on Friday . </s>
<s> If it is correct to find that concerns over corporate debt and LBOs caused Gray Friday , what are the implications for policy makers ? </s>
<s> After all , the stock market 's response to the collapse of the UAL deal might be taken to confirm the UNK direction of regulators . </s>
<s> Is this a case where private markets are UNK of Washington 's UNK of Wall Street ? </s>
<s> UNK not . </s>
<s> To the extent that Friday 's sell-off reflected a sudden UNK of the UNK of leverage , the message is that Wall Street and the private markets are fully capable of imposing the appropriate incentives and sanctions on corporate behavior . </s>
<s> The national economic interests are much better served allowing the private interests of bankers and investors be the ultimate judges of the investment quality of various LBO deals and leveraged UNK . </s>
<s> The recent difficulties in the junk-bond markets and the UNK of bank capital for recent deals UNK the wisdom of letting the free markets operate . </s>
<s> If takeover premiums become excessive , if LBO UNK become too aggressive , then the private market will recognize these problems more quickly and accurately than will policy makers , and the markets will move with UNK speed to impose appropriate sanctions . </s>
<s> Yes , the broader exchanges got caught up in the UNK , but they UNK the UNK up all year . </s>
<s> Not surprisingly , he sometimes UNK . </s>
<s> The arbitragers and takeover UNK got killed on Gray Friday , while the UNK managers of prospective targets UNK UNK . </s>
<s> If you identify with the UNK managers , you must concede that UNK and effective relief from the UNK of the takeover market is more likely to come from the marketplace than from Washington . </s>
<s> If you side with the arbitragers and raiders , you clearly have more to fear from private investors than from regulators , although the Delaware courts should never be UNK . </s>
<s> The truth is , Washington understands politics better than economics . </s>
<s> Although the average citizen is probably not UNK too much from Washington 's UNK war against Wall Street regarding excessive financial UNK , actual legislation would probably impose considerable harm . </s>
<s> Any such attempt to UNK `` good debt '' from `` bad debt , '' or to draw the line at a particular industry , such as the airlines , is likely to UNK the spur that the proper amount of leverage provides both to equity markets and economic efficiency in general . </s>

<s> The continuing series of HUD scandals is a UNK predictable result of pork-barrel politics . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , UNK such as the National Association of Home UNK ( UNK ) continue to pressure Capitol Hill for more UNK spending . </s>
<s> Kent UNK , UNK executive vice president , argues that the U.S. faces a UNK housing crisis -- reduced UNK of homes for UNK buyers , increased homelessness , and lower apartment construction rates -- that will be `` very difficult '' to solve `` without expanded federal resources . '' </s>
<s> There 's nothing unusual about business groups pushing for more government spending . </s>
<s> But the UNK was created in UNK out of an organization that made its name fighting a UNK administration proposal to take over all defense housing production . </s>

<s> Yet on matters close to , UNK , home ... </s>

<s> `` We 've taken more than our fair share . </s>
<s> I would n't have a problem if other programs had taken a similar hit . '' </s>
<s> But UNK support for subsidies is not related to the current housing crunch ; over the years the UNK has backed a host of public programs . </s>
<s> It once pushed for a national housing production goal set by the federal government and has regularly advanced UNK housing measures . </s>
<s> Moreover , explains one HUD official , the UNK remains UNK to internal pressure from members that UNK in subsidized production . </s>
<s> The association is pushing an extensive and expensive UNK , which would substantially boost spending above the current level of more than $ 15 billion annually . </s>
<s> It would like to UNK the ceiling on Federal Housing Administration mortgage guarantees to 95 % of the UNK price in a particular market , instead of limiting it to $ UNK ; reduce ( or even eliminate ) FHA UNK requirements and increase the availability of UNK mortgages ; expand the UNK Affairs Department loan guarantee program ; provide `` adequate '' funding for the Farmers Home Administration ( UNK ) ; increase federal funding and tax incentives for the construction of low-income and rental housing , including $ 4 billion in block grants to states and UNK ; and `` fully fund '' the UNK Act , a $ UNK million UNK for the homeless . </s>
<s> Direct federal subsidies for housing construction have proved UNK expensive in the past , and inevitably are UNK to the benefit of UNK developers and lobbyists , as demonstrated by the ongoing HUD scandal , or congressmen . </s>
<s> UNK subsidies , through the FHA , for instance , are little better . </s>
<s> Though Mr. UNK says expanding FHA lending would result in `` no cost to the government , '' the mere UNK of funds from other parts of the economy and from other forms of housing ( such as low-income ) to the single-family home market would result in a major expense . </s>
<s> More important , housing programs run by HUD , the UNK , and UNK are UNK in red ink . </s>
<s> The FHA alone lost $ 4.2 billion in fiscal 1988 ; the government 's equity in the agency , essentially its reserve fund , fell to minus $ 2.9 billion . </s>
<s> The federal government has had to pump in $ UNK billion into the UNK housing program since 1984 to keep the fund UNK and the UNK requested an additional $ 120 million for the fiscal year just ended . </s>
<s> All told , the federal government already guarantees more than $ 900 billion of mortgages . </s>
<s> In its UNK produced publication `` Where Will Our UNK UNK ? '' the UNK does acknowledge that `` of course , the full measure of housing UNK can not be provided by the federal government . '' </s>
<s> It points to the UNK impact of local government regulation , particularly UNK and building fees , which UNK the price of housing out of the reach of UNK and UNK people . </s>
<s> But while the UNK has suggested actions that states and UNK should take to reduce regulatory barriers , the association has proposed no activist legislative program -- comparable to , say , its detailed request for more federal subsidies -- to eliminate UNK controls . </s>

<s> As Mr. UNK of the UNK acknowledges : `` Government is not going to solve the problem ... . </s>

<s> The barometer , developed by analysts at Columbia University 's Center for International Business UNK Research here , reached a record high of UNK in August , the latest month available , and the Columbia researchers estimate that it has moved even higher since then . </s>
<s> The latest reading of UNK was up from UNK in July and UNK as recently as March . </s>
<s> The August rise marked the fifth straight monthly gain for the indicator , which uses the 1967 average as a base of 100 . </s>
<s> In contrast , the Commerce Department 's widely followed index of leading indicators , while up in August , has fallen repeatedly since reaching a high early this year . </s>
<s> Its UNK behavior through much of 1989 has prompted some UNK to anticipate the start of a new recession perhaps before year 's end . </s>
<s> But the far stronger showing of the Columbia index `` makes a recession any time soon highly unlikely , '' says UNK H. Moore , the director of the Columbia facility . </s>
<s> A leading authority on the business cycle , Mr. Moore also is a member of the Business UNK UNK Group , the panel of private economists that decides for the government when UNK and recessions begin and end . </s>
<s> The group normally UNK only when a change in the economy 's general course seems likely . </s>

<s> They expect a 2.6 % rise in 1990 in the gross national product , after adjustment for inflation . </s>
<s> UNK this optimism is the index 's longstanding ability to signal recessions or UNK , as the case may be , by substantially greater periods than the Commerce Department 's index of leading indicators . </s>
<s> Over the full UNK War II era , the Columbia index , on the average , has entered sustained declines 14 months before the UNK of recessions and turned up eight months before UNK . </s>
<s> The comparable lead times for the Commerce index , whose components include the stock market , are far UNK -- 10 months before recessions and only three months before UNK . </s>

<s> The indicator reached a peak in January 1929 and then fell steadily up to and through the crash . </s>
<s> `` It was an entirely different pattern from what we 're seeing now , '' Mr. Moore says . </s>
<s> A major source of the recent strength in the long leading indicator has been the performance of the Dow Jones corporate UNK index , which is not a part of the Commerce index . </s>
<s> In August , the bond measure was at its highest monthly average since early 1987 . </s>
<s> It also rose last Friday , while the stock market UNK . </s>

<s> UNK UNK from the Columbia index is the stock market , which Mr. Moore says `` is simply no longer such a good indicator of the economy 's UNK prospects , though it still is useful for UNK some UNK UNK and turns . '' </s>
<s> As recently as 1975 , the stock market -- as reflected in the Standard & Poor 's index of 500 common stocks -- was rated by the National Bureau of Economic Research as the best of the 12 leading indicators that then made up the Commerce index . </s>
<s> It was assigned a mark of 80 out of a possible 100 , compared with scores ranging as low as 69 for the other components . </s>
<s> The stock market has lost some UNK power , analysts at the Columbia center claim , because of the growing impact of international developments . </s>
<s> `` Stocks have become more sensitive to factors not directly tied to the domestic economy , '' Mr. Moore says , citing the exchange rate for the dollar on currency markets , the UNK balance and inflows of foreign capital . </s>

<s> The DAX Index of 30 West German blue chips plunged UNK % , a one-day record , UNK out the summer 's gains . </s>
<s> The index closed at UNK , down UNK points . </s>
<s> By comparison , two years ago on Black Monday , the new index would have dropped UNK % , according to a projection by the exchange . </s>
<s> Investors may have reacted so strongly to Friday 's U.S. stock market loss because they had UNK memories of the Frankfurt exchange 's losing 35 % of its value in the 1987 crash and its wake . </s>
<s> This time , however , many small investors may have been hurt by acting so swiftly . </s>
<s> `` They all went in the wrong direction , '' said UNK UNK , an investment adviser for the Bank in UNK 's Frankfurt branch . </s>
<s> He said he told clients to buy selected West German blue chips after they fell by about 10 % . </s>
<s> After the opening was delayed 30 minutes because of the crush of sell orders , Frankfurt 's normal UNK trading session was extended 75 minutes to handle the heavy volume . </s>
<s> `` The beginning was UNK , '' said Nigel UNK , a broker for UNK AG . </s>
<s> `` It took UNK of an hour before enough prices could be worked out to get a reading on the market . '' </s>
<s> Institutional investors and bankers , many of whom spent the night before in their offices watching Far Eastern markets , were cautiously optimistic after the UNK 1.8 % decline in Tokyo stock prices . </s>
<s> `` Everybody was still confident , including most institutional investors . </s>
<s> That is why everybody was a little surprised by the storm of sell orders from small private investors , '' said UNK UNK , a senior trader for UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Some big institutions , including banks , began picking up UNK shares late yesterday , but most investors wanted to see what would happen in New York before acting . </s>
<s> But even if Wall Street continues to stabilize , analysts here say the latest blow to investor confidence could inhibit a swift recovery for the Frankfurt exchange , which already was showing signs of weakness after the DAX had slipped from a 1989 high of UNK on Sept. 8 . </s>
<s> Some of West Germany 's UNK chips took some of the biggest hits . </s>
<s> A UNK % drop for UNK AG and Dresdner Bank AG 's 9.6 % decline were especially UNK for their respective boards , whose plans for major rights issues in November could now be in UNK . </s>
<s> Dresdner Bank last month said it hoped to raise 1.2 billion marks ( $ UNK million ) by issuing four million shares at 300 marks each . </s>
<s> Yet yesterday 's market UNK Dresdner 's share price by 33 marks to UNK marks a share , leaving little incentive for investors to subscribe to the standing price unless the market UNK quickly . </s>

<s> Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been UNK interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said . </s>
<s> Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as UNK , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period . </s>

<s> Security Pacific Corp . </s>

<s> Net rose to $ UNK million , or $ 1.55 a share , from $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share , a year earlier . </s>
<s> The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans ( mainly residential ) , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans . </s>
<s> These UNK loans in effect replaced some UNK assets such as UNK loans , which were allowed to decrease . </s>

<s> A House-Senate conference approved a permanent smoking ban on all domestic airline routes within the UNK U.S. and on all flights of six hours or less to Alaska and Hawaii . </s>
<s> The restrictions would cover all but a small percentage of domestic air traffic , and represent a major expansion of the current smoking ban on flights of two hours or less . </s>
<s> The exemption allowed on longer flights to Alaska and Hawaii appears to be largely a UNK UNK for the traditionally powerful tobacco industry , which has found itself increasingly isolated in the face of public pressure in recent years . </s>
<s> By a UNK margin , House negotiators initially rejected last night a Senate provision covering all domestic flights . </s>
<s> But the UNK compromise was soon agreed to in subsequent discussions . </s>
<s> As a practical matter , flights from the West Coast to Hawaii would be covered as they are under the time limit , but the language would exempt longer routes beginning , for example , in Chicago or on the East Coast . </s>
<s> Within the Senate , the ban has had aggressive support from Sen. Frank UNK ( D. , N.J. ) , who has used his position as a Senate Appropriations subcommittee chairman to UNK votes for the initiative . </s>
<s> The measure is attached to the more than $ 26 billion fiscal 1990 transportation bill within Mr. UNK 's jurisdiction , and the final compromise is UNK with more than $ UNK million in road projects earmarked by members as well as funds sought by major airports , including Denver . </s>
<s> From the UNK , the tobacco industry has been uncertain as to what strategy to follow . </s>
<s> But the industry retains support in the House leadership through the influence of grower states , such as North Carolina . </s>
<s> Majority UNK William Gray owes a political debt to Southern agriculture lawmakers for his rise in the House , and the Philadelphia Democrat used his position in the conference to salvage the exemption from a total ban . </s>
<s> Although the smoking provision has attracted the most public interest , the underlying bill was the subject of UNK lobbying because of its impact on air transportation and the more UNK , but politically important , projects of members . </s>
<s> In a UNK lesson in the power of the appropriations committees , the House deliberately killed a handful of projects backed by lawmakers in Florida , Illinois and Pennsylvania who had voted against the panel leadership on the House floor . </s>

<s> Within the Federal Aviation Administration , the final bill promises to increase spending for facilities and equipment by more than 20 % from last year , and total operations would rise to $ UNK billion -- a 12 % boost . </s>
<s> The facilities account includes $ 40 million for Denver 's ambitious new airport , and the competition for these funds created shifting alliances between urban lawmakers representing established airports in Philadelphia and Michigan and the major carriers to Denver , United and Continental . </s>
<s> UNK of the costs -- and , critics say , competition -- the airlines have sought to gain leverage over the city of Denver . </s>
<s> Texas Air Corp. , which owns Continental , and the Air Transport Association were prominent in the lobbying . </s>
<s> The industry sought to impose conditions that would have delayed funds for the project until Denver and the airlines had agreed to leases for 50 % of the UNK . </s>
<s> But this was rejected in favor of much UNK language UNK the Transportation Department to review the costs of the first phase , expected to cost about $ 2 billion . </s>
<s> Though smaller in total dollars , the conference agreed to preserve an estimated $ UNK million in controversial subsidies to carriers serving rural or isolated airports . </s>
<s> The sum is more than double what the House had approved for the program , but the list of qualified airports would be cut by 22 under new distance requirements and limits on the level of subsidy . </s>
<s> Congress previously cut six airports this year . </s>
<s> The impact of the changes is to eliminate many of the most excessive cases where the government has been paying more than $ 200 for each passenger in subsidies . </s>
<s> Among rail and highway accounts , the agreement provides $ UNK million for UNK , including $ 85 million for capital improvements . </s>
<s> And UNK grants for mass UNK would be effectively frozen at $ UNK billion , or $ 20 million more than last fiscal year . </s>

<s> One of the major concerns expressed by the UNK was that large airlines would be prohibited from UNK themselves of smaller entities and producing independent UNK companies . </s>
<s> For the moment , at least , UNK has replaced anxiety on Wall Street . </s>
<s> The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped sharply yesterday to close at UNK , panic did n't sweep the world 's markets , and investors large and small seemed to accept Friday 's dizzying 190-point plunge as a sharp correction , not a UNK . </s>
<s> Many went UNK . </s>
<s> Among those UNK with relief was John H. UNK , chairman of Salomon Brothers , who took to the firm 's trading floor to monitor yesterday 's events . </s>
<s> As the rally gained strength at UNK p.m. , he UNK broadly , UNK his UNK UNK and UNK Stanley UNK , his top stock trader , on the back . </s>
<s> At first , it seemed as if history might repeat itself . </s>
<s> As trading opened yesterday morning on the Big Board , stocks of many of the nation 's biggest companies could n't open for trading because a wave of sell orders was overwhelming buyers . </s>
<s> By UNK , the Dow UNK were off UNK points , and the stock of UAL Corp. , whose troubles had kicked off Friday 's plunge , still had n't opened . </s>
<s> But then , as quickly as the Dow had fallen , it began to turn around . </s>
<s> It ended with a gain of UNK points . </s>
<s> By the market 's close , volume on the New York exchange totaled more than UNK million , the fourth highest on record . </s>
<s> The Big Board handled the huge volume without any obvious strain , in sharp contrast to Black Monday of 1987 . </s>
<s> But the rally was largely UNK to the blue-chip stocks , which had been hard hit during Friday 's selling frenzy . </s>
<s> Overall , more Big Board stocks lost money than gained . </s>
<s> And many arbitragers , already UNK from Friday 's collapse of the UAL deal , were further hurt yesterday when a proposed takeover of AMR Corp. , the parent of American Airlines , collapsed . </s>
<s> Indeed , the Dow Jones Transportation Average plunged UNK points , its UNK drop in history . </s>
<s> UNK , trading was generally UNK . </s>
<s> The Frankfurt stock exchange was hardest hit of the major markets , with blue chips there falling UNK % . </s>
<s> In London , a midday rally left the market 's major index off 3.2 % , and Tokyo 's leading stock index fell only 1.8 % in surprisingly lackluster trading . </s>
<s> Other , more UNK traded Asian markets were hit harder than Tokyo 's , but there were no UNK declines . </s>
<s> Investors big and small say they learned valuable UNK since the 1987 crash : In this age of computerized trading , huge UNK or UNK in a few hours ' time must be expected . </s>
<s> What 's more , such short-term UNK are UNK and are no cause for panic selling . </s>
<s> Stephen UNK , a major money manager for T. Rowe Price in Baltimore , says , `` There was less panic than in 1987 : We had been through it once . '' </s>
<s> In UNK , Wis. , UNK UNK , who owns a supplier of UNK equipment and is n't active in the stock market , agrees . </s>
<s> `` I look at it as a UNK matter , '' he says . </s>
<s> Many other factors played a part in yesterday 's comeback . </s>
<s> The Federal Reserve signaled its willingness to provide liquidity ; the interest rate on its loans to major banks inched downward early in the day . </s>
<s> Foreign stock markets , which kicked off Black Monday with a huge selling spree , began the day off by relatively modest amounts . </s>
<s> The dollar , after falling sharply in overnight trading to UNK yen , UNK back strongly to UNK , thus easing fears that foreigners would UNK U.S. stocks . </s>
<s> And the widely UNK opinion among most market experts that a crash was n't in store also helped UNK investors . </s>
<s> Many major institutions , for example , came into work yesterday ready to buy some of the blue chips they felt had been sharply undervalued on Friday . </s>
<s> Still , amid all the UNK and signs of relief over yesterday 's events , some market professionals cautioned that there is nothing present in the current market system to prevent another dizzying drop such as Friday 's . </s>
<s> `` There is too much UNK , '' says money manager Barry UNK . </s>
<s> Computers have increasingly connected securities markets world-wide , so that a buying or selling wave in one market is often passed around the globe . </s>
<s> So investors everywhere UNK UNK yesterday 's opening in Tokyo , where the Nikkei average of 225 blue-chip stocks got off to a UNK start . </s>
<s> The average plunged some 600 points , or 1.7 % , in the first 20 minutes of trading . </s>
<s> But the selling wave had no conviction , and the market first surged upward by 200 points , then drifted lower , closing down UNK . </s>
<s> Unlike two years ago , most of Japan 's major investors chose to sit this UNK out . </s>
<s> In Merrill Lynch & Co. 's Tokyo trading room , some 40 traders and UNK sat quietly , with few orders to process . </s>
<s> UNK `` are all staying out '' of the market , one Merrill trader says . </s>
<s> The relative UNK in Tokyo proved little comfort to markets opening up in Europe . </s>
<s> Frankfurt 's opening was delayed a half hour because of a crush of sell orders . </s>
<s> `` The beginning was UNK , '' says Nigel UNK , a broker for UNK </s>
<s> In London , the view from the trading floor of an American securities firm , Jefferies & Co. , also was troubling . </s>

<s> The screen was a sea of red . </s>
<s> `` I see concern , but I do n't see panic , '' says J. Francis UNK , a New UNK who runs the UNK office . </s>
<s> London 's blue-chip stock index turned up just before 8 a.m . New York time , sending an encouraging message to Wall Street . </s>
<s> When trading opened in New York at UNK a.m. EDT , stocks fell sharply -- as expected . </s>

<s> By UNK , the industrial average had dropped 27 points . </s>
<s> By 10 a.m. , it was down 49 . </s>
<s> Ten minutes later , the Dow hit bottom - down UNK points , another 2.5 % . </s>
<s> But shortly before then , some of Wall Street 's UNK traders say , they UNK a turn . </s>
<s> `` The first thing that caught my eye that was encouraging was Treasury bonds were off , '' says Austin George , head of stock trading at T. Rowe Price . </s>
<s> `` It meant that people were n't running UNK to the safety of bonds . '' </s>
<s> Shortly after 10 a.m. , the Major Market Index , a Chicago Board of Trade futures contract of 20 stocks designed to UNK the UNK , exploded upward . </s>
<s> Stock traders were buoyed -- because an UNK in the UNK had also started the recovery in stocks on the Tuesday following Black Monday . </s>
<s> `` The UNK has gone better , '' UNK a trader in the London office of Shearson Lehman Hutton . </s>
<s> Shearson 's London trading room went wild . </s>

<s> Then , nine minutes later , Wall Street suddenly rebounded to a gain on the day . </s>
<s> `` Rally , rally , rally , '' UNK Shearson 's UNK Rosen . </s>
<s> `` This is panic buying . '' </s>
<s> Major blue-chip stocks like Philip Morris , General Motors and UNK & Gamble led the rally . </s>

<s> Then , traders say , corporations with share buy-back programs kicked into high gear , UNK gains in , among other issues , UNK UNK and McDonald 's . </s>
<s> Walt Disney Co. , which had one of the biggest UNK imbalances on Friday and was one of seven stocks that halted trading and never reopened that day , opened yesterday late at UNK , down 8.5 . </s>
<s> But then it suddenly burst upward 7.5 as Goldman , Sachs & Co. stepped in and bought almost every share offer , traders said . </s>
<s> By UNK , the Dow had turned up for the day , prompting UNK on trading desks and exchange floors . </s>
<s> Among Big Board specialists , the UNK was `` UNK your offers '' -- meaning that specialists soon expected to get higher prices for their shares . </s>
<s> `` It was UNK on the upside , '' said one Big Board specialist . </s>
<s> `` What we had was a real , UNK rally . '' </s>
<s> This technical strength spurred buying from Wall Street 's `` black boxes , '' computer programs designed to trigger large stock purchases during bullish periods . </s>
<s> Typical , perhaps , was UNK 's Dean UNK . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK , who manages $ 10 billion , says , `` We turned the trading system on , and it did whatever it was UNK to do . '' </s>
<s> Asked what stocks the computer bought , the money manager says , `` I do n't know . '' </s>
<s> Not everybody was making money . </s>
<s> The UNK on the Chicago Board Options Exchange , the nation 's major options market , was heavy after the trading in S&P 100 stock-index options was halted Friday . </s>
<s> Many market makers in the S&P 100 index options contract had bullish positions Friday , and when the shutdown came they were frozen with huge losses . </s>
<s> Over the weekend , clearing firms told the Chicago market makers to get out of their positions at any cost Monday morning . </s>
<s> `` They were absolutely killed , UNK , '' said one Chicago-based options trader . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , a test of the stock market 's rally came at about 2 p.m. , with the Dow at UNK , up 31 points on the day . </s>

<s> UNK on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads UNK a familiar message : UNK on investing , the market 's just fine . </s>
<s> Their mission is to keep clients from UNK the market , as individual investors did in UNK after the crash in October </s>
<s> Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to UNK investors . </s>
<s> This time around , they 're moving even faster . </s>
<s> PaineWebber Inc. UNK a new television commercial at 4 p.m. EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night . </s>
<s> Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today . </s>
<s> Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads . </s>
<s> It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday . </s>
<s> Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co. , were UNK out potential new ad strategies . </s>
<s> The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when UNK investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic . </s>
<s> This time , the firms were ready . </s>
<s> Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge . </s>
<s> When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday UNK of half a dozen newspapers . </s>
<s> The ads UNK Fidelity 's automated UNK beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is UNK For Your Call . '' </s>
<s> A Fidelity spokesman says the UNK , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend . </s>
<s> `` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial . </s>
<s> It would have been too late to think about on Friday . </s>
<s> We had to think about it ahead of time . '' </s>
<s> Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity . </s>
<s> UNK the headline `` UNK , '' it UNK , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . '' </s>
<s> It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name . </s>
<s> PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began UNK commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night . </s>
<s> It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which UNK would agree to air its last-minute UNK . </s>
<s> The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co. , features Mary UNK , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , UNK particularly bullish . </s>
<s> UNK just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms. UNK advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ... . </s>
<s> We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation . '' </s>
<s> The spot was scheduled to appear three times on UNK last night . </s>
<s> PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks . </s>
<s> Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its UNK to keep that money in the market . </s>
<s> `` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John UNK , PaineWebber 's director of advertising . </s>
<s> `` If you owned it and UNK it Friday , the true value has n't changed . '' </s>
<s> He adds , `` This is n't 1987 UNK . '' </s>
<s> With the market UNK and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly UNK their approach . </s>
<s> At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to UNK yesterday afternoon . </s>
<s> The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's UNK , UNK `` Where We UNK '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 . </s>
<s> The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` UNK by UNK . '' </s>
<s> But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad . </s>
<s> `` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said . </s>
<s> The market seems to be UNK out ; we 're taking a UNK attitude , '' says UNK B. Stewart , executive vice president of marketing . </s>
<s> In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 . </s>
<s> But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective . </s>
<s> In 1987 , despite a UNK of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around . </s>

<s> The UNK is that the $ 28 million was UNK from the funds of this federally insured institution even as UNK was losing money hand over UNK . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul had no right to buy art for the S&L in the first place -- it is n't on the comptroller 's `` UNK '' list -- without seeking a special UNK , which he did not do . </s>
<s> Besides that , some of the paintings that were to UNK the walls of UNK actually ended up hanging in the chairman 's estate on La UNK UNK off Miami Beach . </s>
<s> Last spring , the comptroller 's office called a halt to Mr. Paul 's UNK , giving him six months to sell the paintings . </s>

<s> It is Mr. Paul 's art venture , however , that has drawn the most attention from investors and regulators , not to mention UNK throughout the world . </s>

<s> He established his reputation as a UNK in January last year at Sotheby 's auction of the Linda and Gerald UNK collection in New York . </s>
<s> There , on one of his first shopping trips , Mr. Paul picked up several paintings at stunning prices . </s>
<s> He paid $ 2.2 million , for instance , for a still life by UNK UNK UNK UNK that was expected to fetch perhaps $ UNK . </s>
<s> The price paid was a record for the artist . </s>

<s> Mr. UNK , who became his principal adviser , searched UNK in London , Paris and UNK . </s>
<s> And , according to one dealer , Mr. UNK had a UNK for introducing Mr. Paul with the phrase : `` He can buy anything . '' </s>

<s> People were interested in seeing him , but it was recognized that the route was through Sotheby 's and particularly George UNK . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Paul thus developed a close , UNK relationship with Sotheby 's . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul was eager to UNK a collection for the headquarters UNK has been moving into for the greater part of a year . </s>
<s> Sotheby 's , the auction house founded in London UNK and now under the UNK of Sotheby 's Holdings Inc. , was hoping to UNK up interest in old UNK as it UNK to build its U.S. business . </s>
<s> European dealers continued to dominate the action in old UNK , which Sotheby 's North America had lately been touting in this country . </s>
<s> For several months , there was optimism all around . </s>
<s> Last October , Mr. Paul paid out $ 12 million of UNK 's cash -- plus a $ 1.2 million commission -- for `` UNK of a Man as UNK . '' </s>
<s> The painting , attributed to UNK artist Peter Paul UNK , was purchased privately through Sotheby 's , not at auction . </s>
<s> In March 1989 , just 15 months into his campaign , Mr. Paul was named by Art & UNK magazine as one of the top 100 individual UNK in the U.S. . </s>

<s> ( Mr. Paul says it was n't that high . ) </s>
<s> The art collection might have come to rival the UNK ' had the Florida comptroller 's office not got wind of Mr. Paul 's UNK UNK . </s>
<s> In its letter to him , dated March 2 and shared with reporters , Alex UNK , the chief of the UNK bureau in the comptroller 's office , expressed UNK that the S&L could be so UNK when it had reported losses of more than $ 13 million in its two UNK quarters . </s>
<s> The state gave UNK 30 days to sell the UNK . </s>
<s> The comptroller 's office eventually extended the deadline to six months but UNK its demands , ordering that the `` book value of the collection { be } reduced to zero . '' </s>
<s> In other words : Get rid of all the pictures . </s>
<s> The state UNK noted that UNK banking practices are grounds for removing an officer or director and closed with the UNK to Mr. Paul : `` UNK yourself UNK . '' </s>
<s> The state agency was particularly UNK to learn that the UNK and a UNK other paintings listed among the bank 's `` furniture and UNK , '' were actually hanging in the chairman 's house . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul says that at one point he did indeed have eight or nine of the paintings at home and that the rest were in storage at Sotheby 's . </s>
<s> He explains that he was `` merely UNK the paintings at home -- with some display -- because of the special UNK environment '' required for their UNK , until UNK 's new building was ready for them . </s>
<s> Still , the incident was embarrassing . </s>
<s> It came on the heels of a number of local newspaper articles suggesting that Mr. Paul has benefited UNK from his association with UNK . </s>
<s> For instance , he got a $ 3 million loan from the S&L , negotiated at a UNK rate . </s>
<s> He owns 43 % of UNK 's shares . </s>
<s> UNK to Mr. Paul 's problems , dealers ( some with vested interests ) insist that he , UNK rather too heavily on Sotheby 's advice , paid much too much for several pieces in the UNK collection . </s>
<s> The $ 12 million UNK on the UNK , for example , was a record price for the artist and maybe twice its value , given a dispute among scholars about its UNK . </s>
<s> David UNK , the president of David UNK Inc. , a New York gallery , says scholars question the UNK of the UNK . </s>
<s> It may have been painted instead by a UNK associate . </s>
<s> `` The feeling among many experts on the commercial side is that the price paid at the time was excessive in any event , '' Mr. UNK says . </s>
<s> `` It sounds like with the UNK he got absolutely taken to the UNK . '' </s>
<s> Victor UNK , the executive director of the UNK Association of America , agrees that Mr. Paul paid very UNK for the UNK and adds that getting rid of it any time soon for a similar sum would be quite a UNK . </s>
<s> `` It 's not beyond credibility the UNK will UNK be worth $ 12 million , but whether it could be sold for that amount tomorrow remains to be seen . '' </s>
<s> Still , predicting is tricky . </s>
<s> `` I 'm forever UNK by what I see making these high prices . '' </s>
<s> Jonathan H. UNK , the son of the painting 's former owner , Mrs. UNK UNK , UNK the price talk as `` sour UNK . '' </s>

<s> Art prices are UNK , but a good deal of UNK is involved in UNK statistics on sales . </s>

<s> ( UNK and modern paintings , not tracked by Salomon , are ranked even higher at 74 % by Sotheby 's . ) </s>

<s> The UNK UNK from consideration the many paintings that go UNK at auction . </s>
<s> Art indexes track winners , not losers . </s>
<s> But art that has fallen sharply in value is rarely put up for sale . </s>

<s> It 's not that there are n't any bids , but the bids do n't meet the minimum `` reserve '' prices set by the sellers . </s>

<s> `` After a few years , you can argue there has been natural appreciation , '' says Susan UNK , the publisher of Leonard 's UNK Price Index of Art UNK . </s>

<s> Mr. UNK says Mr. Paul was a quick study who worked UNK and bought the best pictures available at the moment . </s>
<s> `` On UNK , he paid a high price , '' Mr. UNK concedes , but he says those who bid less and dropped out were dealers who would then have marked up the paintings to UNK them at a profit to UNK . </s>
<s> UNK UNK UNK , a UNK UNK at UNK Associates in San Francisco , considers it `` UNK conflict of interest for an auction house to both advise a client on purchases and to set price estimates on the paintings to be purchased . '' </s>
<s> Sotheby 's , she says , is `` wearing both hats . '' </s>
<s> `` I ca n't see why there would be a conflict of interest , '' says Sotheby 's Ms. UNK . </s>
<s> `` UNK are based on the previous price of similar works sold at auction and current market conditions , and are not affected by any knowledge of who the potential buyer could be . '' </s>
<s> UNK , clients express interest in paintings but do n't end up bidding , she adds , `` so we do n't know who the potential buyer will be . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Paul , in selling off his paintings , is seeking at least a 15 % return on the bank 's investment , so as to prove that the venture was sound . </s>
<s> Mr. Paul says that he has UNK out over much of the globe and that potential buyers from as far away as Japan and Italy have examined the collection . </s>
<s> Because of the pressure on UNK to sell , dealers and UNK have been trying to get the paintings at UNK prices . </s>
<s> But so far , Mr. Paul and his advisers are holding fast . </s>

<s> UNK - Options traders were among the big victims of Friday 's plunging stock market , including one small firm that required an emergency $ 50 million bailout . </s>
<s> While Monday 's UNK markets helped other investors UNK losses , many options customers and professional traders in stock-index options and the options on takeover stocks were left with UNK losses , traders here and in New York said . </s>
<s> Options traders were hurt worse than others on Friday because of the highly volatile nature of options , which often rise or fall in value several times the amount of the price change in the individual stock or index of stocks on which they are based . </s>
<s> Thus , options traders Friday were stuck with losses that also were several times larger than those suffered by many stock traders in New York . </s>
<s> Jeffrey Miller of Miller UNK UNK & Co. said that given the high degree of leverage in the options market , it is `` very easy for these guys to get wiped out . </s>
<s> That may just be the nature of these highly leveraged little creatures . '' </s>
<s> An options contract gives the holder the right to buy ( call ) or sell ( put ) a specific amount of stock , or in this case the value of a stock index , based on a UNK price within a given time period . </s>
<s> Options traders who , in return for a small fee , or premium , had previously sold put options on stocks or stock indexes were forced on Friday to buy those contracts back at the previously agreed prices , which were substantially above those in the market as it was falling . </s>
<s> They then had no choice in many cases but to sell the contracts at UNK prices -- in most cases at a substantial loss . </s>
<s> The latest round of losses is likely to be a serious blow to the Chicago Board Options Exchange , which has never fully recovered from the UNK of Black Monday , when investors fled the market because of huge losses . </s>
<s> UNK matters worse was the fact that late Friday afternoon the CBOE halted stock-index options trading in step with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange 's halt in stock-index futures . </s>
<s> But while the Merc reopened a half hour later , the CBOE remained closed , leaving many options traders unable to make trades that might have reduced the losses . </s>
<s> CBOE Chairman UNK `` Duke '' UNK , said that , unlike the futures market , the options exchange has to open in a UNK that allows each different options series to trade . </s>
<s> Exchange officials UNK that they would n't have been able to make such a UNK with the time remaining Friday afternoon , and with the stock-index futures on the UNK of closing for a second and final time , the CBOE UNK that its best course was to remain closed . </s>
<s> The damage was so bad at UNK Corp. , an options trading firm here , that it was forced to transfer its accounts to First Options of Chicago , a unit of Continental Bank Corp. , as a result of options trading losses . </s>
<s> UNK so far is the only member of a financial exchange to be forced to be taken over by another firm as a result of Friday 's UNK . </s>
<s> UNK still had several million dollars in capital left after Friday 's close of trading , but not enough that regulators , worried about another potential market plunge yesterday , would let it reopen for trading , options exchange officials said . </s>
<s> Thus , in an unprecedented arrangement UNK the UNK of the transfer , the CBOE , the American Stock Exchange and the Options Clearing Corp. , as well as the firm 's owner , Stephen UNK , put up a total of $ 50 million to guarantee the customer positions being transferred to the bank holding company subsidiary in case the market plunged again yesterday . </s>
<s> S. UNK UNK III , vice chairman of Continental Bank , First Options ' parent company , said the firm took on about 160 accounts formerly held by UNK , almost all of them UNK to professional floor traders . </s>
<s> `` Steve and his firm were still worth a lot of money , '' Mr. UNK said . </s>
<s> `` A package of credit support was put together -- including the assets of Steve and his firm . '' </s>
<s> The bailout was UNK together over the weekend , with officials from the Federal Reserve Board , Securities and Exchange Commission , UNK of the Currency and Treasury as well as the options exchanges . </s>
<s> `` It was great to have the luxury of time , '' Mr. UNK said . </s>
<s> At one point , an options industry official had to talk the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago 's night UNK into giving him the home phone number of UNK UNK , Chicago Fed president . </s>
<s> First Options did n't have to put any money into the bailout . </s>
<s> Yesterday 's rally in the stock , futures and options markets led CBOE and Amex officials to conclude that the $ 50 million in guarantees almost certainly wo n't need to be tapped by First Options . </s>
<s> The UNK firm had some losses and liquidity problems during the October 1987 crash as well , Mr. UNK said . </s>
<s> A federal official said that Continental Bank worked with securities and banking regulators over the weekend to fashion the UNK bailout , but that conditions were n't UNK by those agencies . </s>
<s> `` It was their business decision , '' the official said . </s>
<s> Officials at Options Clearing Corp. , which processes all options trades for U.S. exchanges , said that the $ 50 million guarantee was unprecedented , but was necessary to help insure the integrity of the options markets . </s>
<s> `` It was an extraordinary situation that needed extraordinary steps , '' said Paul Stevens , UNK president and chief operating officer . </s>
<s> Mr. Stevens declined to give the specific contributions to the $ 50 million guarantee from each participant . </s>
<s> But CBOE and Amex officials said that Options Clearing Corp. contributed $ 20 million to the guarantee , the CBOE put up $ 8 million , the Amex added $ 4 million and $ 18 million came from Mr. UNK 's own assets . </s>

<s> The turmoil on Wall Street may benefit some retailers attempting to lead leveraged buy-outs of their specialty and department-store chains , investment bankers and retailers said . </s>
<s> Managers at five chains have said in recent weeks that they intend to bid for their companies . </s>
<s> The chains include Bloomingdale 's , owned by Campeau Corp. , Toronto ; Saks Fifth Avenue and Marshall Field 's , owned by B.A.T Industries PLC , London ; and B. UNK & Co. and UNK Inc. , owned by Hooker Corp. , which is now being managed by a UNK provisional UNK . </s>
<s> Hooker is based in Sydney , Australia . </s>
<s> The combination of so many chains available for sale , the recent failures of such retailing LBO 's as Miller & UNK Inc. and declining investor confidence will drive down prices , retailing observers said . </s>
<s> `` The pricing will become more realistic , which should help management , '' said Bruce UNK , a New York investment banker with Nathan S. UNK & Co . </s>
<s> `` Investors are n't going to be throwing money at any of the proposed LBOs , but doing deals on the basis of ridiculous assumptions never made sense , either . '' </s>
<s> Earlier this year , bankers and other investors were willing to provide financing because they assumed there would be major gains in both profitability and sales , Mr. UNK added . </s>
<s> Those days are over now , he believes . </s>
<s> `` UNK from third parties who have cash and are prepared to buy has always existed and will continue , '' added Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> `` But when prices were crazy , it was even harder to do an LBO . </s>
<s> Bankers believed in the UNK theory that says somebody else is always willing to pay more . </s>
<s> This is no longer true today . '' </s>
<s> At Saks Fifth Avenue , Paul UNK , senior vice president , marketing , agreed that lower prices will help his management team in their proposed LBO . </s>
<s> `` Having to take on less debt would certainly be an advantage , '' said Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> `` It would also help us in our search for equity partners . </s>
<s> To make an LBO work , now we are going to need more than just junk bonds . </s>
<s> '' None believe the proposed management LBOs will be easy to complete , especially at B. UNK & Co. , which is under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection . </s>
<s> Not only could the Wall Street gyrations damp Christmas sales if consumers lose confidence in the economy , but potential junk-bond buyers are sure to demand even stronger UNK and greater management equity participation . </s>
<s> Further , many institutions today holding troubled retailers ' debt securities will be UNK to consider additional retailing investments . </s>
<s> `` It 's called bad money driving out good money , '' said one retailing UNK . </s>
<s> `` Institutions that usually buy retail paper have to be more concerned . '' </s>
<s> However , the lower prices these retail chains are now expected to bring should make it easier for managers to raise the necessary capital and pay back the resulting debt . </s>
<s> In addition , the fall selling season has generally been a good one , especially for those retailers dependent on apparel sales for the majority of their revenues . </s>
<s> `` What 's encouraging about this is that retail chains will be sold on the basis of their sales and earnings , not liquidation values , '' said Joseph E. Brooks , chairman and chief executive officer of Ann Taylor Inc. , a specialty chain . </s>
<s> `` UNK who had good track records of producing profits will have a better chance to buy back their companies . '' </s>
<s> Still , most retailing observers expect that all the proposed retailing LBOs will depend partly on the sale of junk bonds , a market already in UNK , in part because of concerns associated with bonds issued by the Federated and Allied units of Campeau . </s>
<s> `` Prices for retail chains are lower today than they were last week , which will help management , '' said UNK Harrison , chairman of UNK Inc. , an investment-banking firm specializing in retailing acquisitions . </s>
<s> `` But the UNK of financing still has to be resolved . </s>
<s> UNK bondholders will either look for greater equity participation on behalf of management , or insist the equity component of the deals be substantially greater than in the past . </s>

<s> K mart Corp. agreed to acquire UNK UNK UNK Inc. for $ 23 a share , or $ UNK million , in a move to expand its presence in the rapidly growing UNK business . </s>
<s> The proposed merger comes as K mart 's profit is declining and sales at its core discount stores are rising more slowly than at such competitors as UNK Stores Inc . </s>
<s> K mart , based in UNK , Mich. , recently said net income would fall for the third consecutive quarter , after a 16 % drop in the first half of its current fiscal year . </s>
<s> `` The membership UNK concept has great potential , '' the company 's chairman , Joseph E. UNK , said in a statement . </s>
<s> UNK clubs typically carry general merchandise and food products , which they sell for close to wholesale prices in UNK stores . </s>
<s> UNK , many of whom operate small businesses , pay annual membership fees , which provide an income base for the stores . </s>
<s> K mart tested the UNK sector last year with its acquisition of a 51 % interest in UNK Inc . </s>
<s> But the UNK chain , which operates as a joint venture between K mart and UNK Holdings N.V. of the Netherlands , has only six stores and annual sales that one analyst estimated at about $ 300 million . </s>
<s> UNK UNK , based in UNK , Colo. , operates 41 UNK stores . </s>
<s> The company had losses for several years before turning profitable in fiscal 1988 . </s>
<s> In the year ended Jan. 31 , UNK UNK up profit of $ UNK million , or 72 cents a share , after a tax-loss UNK , on sales of $ 1.3 billion , and analysts expect its results to continue to improve . </s>
<s> `` The company turned the corner fairly recently in profitability , '' said UNK UNK of PaineWebber Inc. , who had been forecasting a 46 % jump in UNK 's net income from operations this year and another 42 % increase next year . </s>
<s> `` UNK productivity is really beginning to take off . '' </s>
<s> But some analysts contend K mart has agreed to pay too much for UNK . </s>
<s> `` Even if you look at it as a turnaround situation , it 's expensive , '' said Wayne UNK of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . </s>
<s> `` In my opinion , you would only pay that kind of price if you were getting a premier player in the industry . '' </s>
<s> Ms. UNK of PaineWebber raised a more fundamental question about the deal . </s>
<s> `` If K mart ca n't get its act together in discounting , why is it spending time worrying about other growing markets ? '' </s>
<s> She said , `` I would say K mart 's number one job is to address its UNK loss { in discount stores } , which longer-term will lead to improved profit margins . </s>
<s> At that point , perhaps diversification would be appropriate . '' </s>
<s> But K mart 's Mr. UNK is intent on pushing the company into new retail businesses . </s>
<s> For instance , K mart is opening big food and general merchandise stores , called UNK , and UNK stores specializing in office products and UNK goods . </s>
<s> It also operates UNK , UNK UNK Drug Stores and UNK Square home improvement stores . </s>
<s> In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange , K mart closed yesterday at $ 36 a share , up 12.5 cents . </s>
<s> UNK rose $ UNK to close at $ UNK a share in national over-the-counter trading . </s>
<s> A K mart spokesman said the acquisition would be financed with short-term borrowings . </s>
<s> Under terms of the agreement , a K mart subsidiary will soon make a tender offer for UNK shares . </s>
<s> Among the conditions of the offer is that UNK shareholders tender a majority of the company 's shares outstanding . </s>

<s> The UNK 's huge bureaucracy is needed to analyze whether leaders of UNK against Gen. Noriega meet the War UNK Act 's six points , UNK UNK 's seven points , the Intelligence Committee 's 32 points and UNK Wilson 's 14 points necessary to justify U.S. support . </s>
<s> So far no one has . </s>
<s> The ghost of the Soviet UNK discovered in Cuba back in the UNK costs just a few hundred million : the price of the Caribbean UNK in UNK West that President Carter created in 1980 . </s>
<s> The UNK has n't been heard from since , but we keep the staff around just in case . </s>
<s> George Marshall 's ghost is much more difficult to keep happy . </s>
<s> We keep a lot of UNK to him around the Pentagon : UNK , UNK , UNK and such . </s>
<s> The Army headquarters on the third deck of the Pentagon used to UNK a lot of UNK to him , but the Navy headquarters on the fourth deck made them stop it . </s>
<s> You see , Marshall had this thing about the Navy and the UNK -- he wanted to make them part of the Army but Secretary of the Navy James UNK blocked him . </s>
<s> Now his ghost wo n't let up UNK it 's done . </s>
<s> To keep him quiet we UNK a new unified command every year or so run by the Army or the Air Force and put more of the Navy and UNK under it . </s>
<s> But we still hear him UNK at night because the Navy has a few ships left , and to satisfy him the Navy 's sea lift forces were given to a new Air Force bureaucracy in Illinois , its space operations to another command in Colorado , the UNK to a new Army bureaucracy in Fort UNK , and the Navy 's Indian Ocean and UNK Gulf forces to an Army bureaucracy in Florida . </s>
<s> Which brings up the worst and UNK ghost of all -- the ghost of the UNK of Iran . </s>
<s> When the UNK died , President Carter was so scared that the UNK 's ghost would blame him for UNK him out to make way for the UNK that he declared the Carter UNK . </s>
<s> Mr. Carter said he would go to war to stop anyone from trying to grab Iran . </s>
<s> But that ghost would n't settle for words , he wanted money and people -- lots . </s>
<s> So Mr. Carter formed three new Army divisions and gave them to a new bureaucracy in UNK called the UNK UNK Force . </s>
<s> But that ghost was n't UNK ; he knew the UNK was neither rapid nor UNK nor a force -- even though it cost $ 8 billion or $ 10 billion a year . </s>
<s> After Mr. Carter was defeated in 1980 , the UNK 's ghost claimed the credit and then went after President Reagan and UNK UNK . </s>
<s> I saw what he did to them UNK . </s>
<s> It made my UNK dance with UNK . </s>
<s> Why , he used to lay in wait for UNK ; suddenly he 'd leap from behind some UNK of Marshall onto UNK 's UNK and grab him by the UNK and UNK him UNK he UNK up an additional $ 2 billion or so . </s>
<s> UNK added four more divisions to the Army , two active and two reserve ; two carrier groups to the Navy ; a division -- equivalent to the UNK ; and the UNK , UNK , UNK and a thousand tactical aircraft to the Air Force . </s>
<s> He bought $ 4 billion in UNK ships and $ 7 billion in UNK and equipment to fill them , and UNK them at a new $ 6 billion base at Diego Garcia in the middle of the Indian Ocean . </s>
<s> He dedicated all these new forces to the UNK Gulf . </s>
<s> One night both Marshall 's ghost and the UNK 's ghost together caught UNK and threw him to the ground . </s>
<s> Before they let him go he added a thousand bureaucrats to the UNK in UNK and renamed it Central UNK . </s>
<s> He gave those bureaucrats charge of all naval operations in the UNK Gulf and Indian Ocean . </s>
<s> Marshall figured it would be good training for those soldiers -- UNK maybe they would get the whole Navy . </s>
<s> They had fun moving the carriers around , but it turned out that they had forgotten all about mine UNK . </s>
<s> But the UNK still kept UNK out at UNK , so UNK bought a hundred merchant ships more and $ 7 billion of UNK UNK , UNK , UNK , in order that those seven new Army divisions and three Marine UNK could UNK from all those new ships and aircraft and go to war in the UNK UNK . </s>
<s> Then suddenly UNK 's ghost came to visit and said , `` What the UNK are you doing planning for a land war in Asia UNK miles away ? </s>
<s> We 'd get our UNK kicked . '' </s>
<s> UNK for UNK , UNK was UNK and soon went away , while the UNK -- he kept coming back . </s>
<s> So the U.S. found itself paying about $ 2 billion in UNK to various Arab UNK for UNK rights around the Indian Ocean . </s>
<s> We had great success in Somalia . </s>
<s> But then it turned out that President UNK UNK was not at all a nice person and the Navy pointed out that the base he promised us in UNK had UNK up about a hundred years ago and anyway was UNK miles from the UNK of the Gulf . </s>
<s> ( But who 's counting . ) </s>
<s> Still , UNK was the best we could get , so we stay in bed with President UNK . </s>
<s> All these reports about him UNK UNK are probably UNK anyway . </s>
<s> But would n't you know , now that we are spending UNK of dollars , and have built those new divisions and new air wings , and have positioned all these ships and supplies to fight the UNK in Iran , the UNK seem to have lost interest in the whole subject . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , Congress is cutting huge UNK out of the rest of the defense budget . </s>
<s> UNK , some Navy guys said : `` Do we still need to keep all 18 Army divisions on active duty and all those extra UNK aircraft without bases and all those Army guys playing UNK in UNK ? </s>
<s> UNK n't we save $ 20 billion or $ 30 billion a year by shifting that stuff to the reserves ? </s>
<s> And why not save the costs of a thousand bureaucrats by UNK Central UNK and putting responsibility for Gulf naval operations back where it belongs , UNK with the task force UNK in the Gulf ? </s>
<s> And where were all our UNK paid Indian Ocean allies last year when our UNK were being attacked ? '' </s>
<s> UNK like that really UNK up Marshall 's ghost . </s>
<s> He appeared late one night in the UNK of the new defense secretary , Dick Cheney . </s>
<s> Marshall came UNK in like UNK 's ghost UNK those chains of UNK and air wings and links with Arab UNK . </s>
<s> He would n't leave until Mr. Cheney promised to do whatever the Pentagon systems analysts told him . </s>
<s> So next day Mr. Cheney went out and did just that : He canceled the UNK Navy and cut back one carrier and 20 UNK . </s>
<s> Then he canceled production of the Navy 's most important carrier aircraft , the UNK and the UNK . </s>
<s> On the other hand , Mr. Cheney retained all those new land forces . </s>
<s> Marshall 's ghost is satisfied for now , but he 'll be back . </s>
<s> What with UNK coming and bigger defense cuts UNK , more and more Pentagon bureaucrats are UNK under their desks . </s>
<s> They know that they can hold off the ghosts only a little while longer by cutting carriers and ships . </s>

<s> The main reason was a delay in UNK of new UNK disk drives , a business that accounts for some 10 % of IBM 's $ 60 billion of annual revenue . </s>
<s> IBM , which UNK the poor results three weeks ago , also cited an increase in its leasing business , which tends to lock in business long-term but cut revenue in the near term . </s>
<s> In addition , IBM noted that the stronger dollar has cut the value of overseas revenue and earnings when they are translated into dollars . </s>
<s> Earnings fell to $ UNK million , or $ UNK a share , somewhat below securities analysts ' revised expectations of around $ UNK a share . </s>
<s> That compared with the year-earlier $ 1.25 billion , or $ UNK a share -- which was inflated by a UNK gain from the sale of some MCI Communications Corp. stock and by an unspecified amount from a payment by Fujitsu Ltd. relating to a software dispute . </s>

<s> IBM is expected to get a boost soon when it UNK some new versions of its mainframes . </s>
<s> But the basic technology in the line is almost five years old , which means it is long in the UNK , and competitors are rolling out strong products of their own . </s>
<s> IBM is gaining momentum in the UNK market , and is expected to introduce some impressive workstations early next year . </s>
<s> But it 's hard to squeeze much profit out of the UNK business these days , and the workstation market , while important , is too small to rely on for much growth . </s>
<s> The disk drives will UNK sell well when they finally become available . </s>
<s> But the UNK / 400 , IBM 's highly successful UNK line , is losing its momentum , and some analysts said sales could even decline in the fourth quarter . </s>
<s> In addition , IBM 's growth in software in the third quarter was just 8.8 % , well below historical levels even when adjusted to reflect last year 's payment from Fujitsu and the stronger dollar . </s>

<s> Polaroid Corp. 's UNK damages case against Eastman Kodak Co. , one of the highest stakes corporate trials ever , is getting UNK attention on Wall Street . </s>
<s> After 78 days of UNK testimony in federal court in Boston , the trial is being all but ignored by analysts and patent attorneys . </s>
<s> Most have read the UNK documents , however , and estimate Kodak will be ordered to pay $ 1 billion to $ 1.5 billion for UNK on seven Polaroid patents . </s>
<s> That may be the largest patent award ever , but it is well below the $ 12 billion Polaroid seeks . </s>
<s> The highest patent damage award to date was in 1986 , when Smith International Inc. was ordered to pay $ UNK million to Baker Hughes Inc. for UNK on a patent on an oil drilling bit UNK . </s>
<s> The two companies later agreed to settle for $ 95 million . </s>
<s> Few analysts think it is worth their time to UNK through the Polaroid trial testimony . </s>
<s> `` It 's like UNK for gold outside of Grand Central UNK . </s>
<s> You might find something , but the chances are low , '' said Michael UNK , an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co . </s>
<s> And Eugene UNK , an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , said : `` If you hired an attorney to be there all the time and give you a ( UNK ) of the eventual award , I would be willing to bet that he would be off '' by a lot . </s>
<s> A UNK trial in the early 1980s determined that Kodak , based in Rochester , N.Y. , UNK on patents of Polaroid , of Cambridge , Mass . </s>
<s> The main issues remaining are how to UNK damages and whether the UNK was `` UNK and UNK . '' </s>
<s> If so , the damages could be tripled . </s>
<s> Two analysts who have read the UNK , David Nelson of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and UNK D. UNK , a litigation analyst at UNK , Simpson & Co. , think Judge A. David UNK will decide in Kodak 's favor on the `` UNK and UNK '' issue . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK said testimony by Kodak 's patent counsel , Francis T. UNK of UNK & UNK , showed that `` he worked with Kodak UNK from the UNK of the project '' in an effort to avoid UNK . </s>
<s> `` UNK told Kodak on many occasions to avoid various features because of Polaroid 's patent positions , '' and Kodak followed his advice in every instance , Mr. UNK said . </s>
<s> But Irving UNK , a patent expert at George Mason University School of Law who is familiar with the case , said the fact that seven patents were UNK `` suggests that UNK was UNK . </s>
<s> It 's difficult to be that consistently wrong . '' </s>
<s> UNK also wonder whether Judge UNK will use the UNK method of determining damages , which Polaroid favors because it would result in a larger award , or the reasonable royalty method . </s>
<s> Polaroid claims it could have manufactured and sold all the instant UNK and film sold by Kodak if Kodak had n't entered the market . </s>
<s> Moreover , Polaroid contends it could have sold them at a higher price -- and thus made higher profits -- because it would n't have been forced to match Kodak 's lower prices . </s>
<s> Each side has called a Harvard Business School professor to testify on that issue . </s>
<s> Kodak hired Robert UNK and Polaroid brought in Robert J. UNK . </s>
<s> `` There 's nothing that says that people at Harvard Business school have to agree with each other , '' said Mr. UNK . </s>

<s> But those who said `` This ca n't be happening '' were right . </s>
<s> The UNK were wrong . </s>
<s> Quotron Systems Inc. , a Citicorp unit , blamed the UNK UNK on `` a timing problem in our software '' caused by the enormous early volume -- about 145 million shares in the first hour of New York Stock Exchange trading . </s>
<s> The prices of the individual stocks that make up the average were correct , Quotron said , but the average was wrong . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , there was an awful lot of confusion . </s>
<s> At about UNK a.m. on the over-the-counter trading desk at a major brokerage firm , a veteran trader who buys and sells some of the most active stocks looked at a senior official and asked , `` What 's going on ? </s>

<s> To UNK matters further , when UAL Corp. stock finally opened on the New York Stock Exchange at UNK a.m. , the price was listed at $ UNK a share , up about $ 45 from Friday ; in fact , its true price was $ UNK , down $ 55 . </s>
<s> That was the New York Stock Exchange 's UNK . </s>
<s> A spokesman cited a `` technical error '' and declined to elaborate . </s>
<s> And there were other UNK . </s>
<s> When the market opened at UNK a.m. EST , a reporter for the Reuters UNK UNK the industrial average 's drop as a 4 % decline when it really was down 0.7 % . </s>
<s> `` It was a case of human error , which we found almost immediately and corrected , '' a spokesman for Reuter in New York said . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , some currency traders at West German banks in Frankfurt said they sold dollars on the news and had to buy them back later at higher prices . </s>
<s> But it was the Quotron problems that had UNK effects . </s>
<s> UNK UNK 's Ms. UNK said in early afternoon that she was still UNK prices and other data as subject to UNK , and she said portfolio managers continued to question the numbers they saw on the screen . </s>
<s> It was the second time in less than a week that Quotron has had problems UNK the industrial average . </s>
<s> At the start of trading last Wednesday , the average appeared to plunge more than 200 points . </s>
<s> Actually , it was down only a few points at the time . </s>
<s> Quotron said that UNK , which lasted nine minutes , resulted from a failure to adjust for a UNK stock split at Philip Morris UNK . </s>
<s> A Quotron spokeswoman said recent software changes may have contributed to yesterday 's problems . </s>

<s> UNK UNK , who represents the Soviet airline UNK here , has some UNK that are wild even by the current standards of perestroika . </s>
<s> In his office UNK the UNK of UNK Airport , Mr. UNK UNK throws out what he calls `` just ideas '' : </s>
<s> First , he suggests , UNK Group Ltd. , the international aircraft leasing company based in Ireland , could lease some of its Boeing UNK to the Soviet airline . </s>
<s> Then UNK UNK , the UNK flag carrier , could teach UNK pilots to fly the UNK , and the fleet could be based here at UNK Airport . </s>
<s> That 's not all , he says . </s>
<s> UNK UNK , the UNK airport authority , could build a cargo terminal in the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> UNK could lease some of its cargo planes to UNK UNK , through UNK , for a joint-venture cargo airline . </s>
<s> And then there is his notion of an UNK charter airline to UNK UNK to Los Angeles via UNK . </s>
<s> Have the freedoms of glasnost gone to Mr. UNK 's head ? </s>
<s> UNK . </s>
<s> The UNK aviation connection is alive and well here at UNK Airport . </s>
<s> UNK is indeed talking about leasing Western planes to UNK and even about buying UNK UNK UNK . </s>
<s> UNK UNK is in discussions with the Soviet carrier about a cargo venture and other possibilities . </s>
<s> UNK UNK already has so many ventures with UNK that its chief executive is studying Russian . </s>
<s> UNK as it may seem , tiny , politically UNK Ireland has UNK the UNK Soviet airline bureaucracy . </s>
<s> And as UNK UNK to boost its service standards , upgrade its fleet and pursue commercial opportunities , the UNK aviation industry seems UNK to benefit . </s>
<s> `` UNK and Soviet people are similar , '' says Mr. UNK . </s>
<s> `` They look the same . </s>
<s> They 're very friendly . '' </s>
<s> Moreover , he says , UNK companies are small but UNK . </s>
<s> `` We have to study their experience very well , '' he says . </s>
<s> `` We must find any way to get business . '' </s>
<s> The two groups have been working together since the late 1970s , long before Soviet joint ventures were the UNK in the West . </s>
<s> UNK carried about 125 million passengers last year , and UNK Airport , the airline 's largest UNK airport outside the Soviet Union , saw UNK UNK flights and 250,000 passengers pass through . </s>
<s> An apartment complex down the road is the UNK and UNK area for more than 130 UNK pilots and flight attendants . </s>
<s> The airport 's biggest supplier of aircraft fuel is the Soviet Union . </s>
<s> UNK from the UNK port of UNK each year UNK 25 million UNK of fuel into a special tank farm at the airport . </s>
<s> What UNK does n't UNK into its own UNK UNK is UNK to the airport authority , which UNK it to 11 Western carriers including Air France , Trans World Airlines and Pakistan International Airlines . </s>
<s> UNK thus pays its landing fees , UNK and UNK bills with fuel , preserving its hard currency . </s>
<s> That is n't all . </s>
<s> Last year , the UNK airport authority , in a joint venture with UNK , opened four UNK duty-free shops at Moscow 's UNK Airport . </s>
<s> UNK UNK now manages duty-free sales on all UNK international flights out of Moscow . </s>
<s> UNK shops in UNK 's UNK Airport opened in July , and UNK shops in UNK hotels and on the UNK UNK are coming soon . </s>

<s> UNK 's international fleet of UNK planes is being UNK and UNK at UNK Airport . </s>
<s> UNK to a new UNK agreement and the ability of UNK travel agents to issue UNK tickets , tourists here are taking advantage of UNK 's reasonable prices to board flights in UNK for UNK in UNK , UNK and Mexico City . </s>
<s> The UNK fare to UNK is UNK UNK UNK ( $ UNK ) . </s>

<s> A formal blessing of sorts was UNK on this friendship in April when Mikhail and UNK Gorbachev stopped here for talks with UNK Prime Minister Charles UNK . </s>
<s> New trade UNK were signed . </s>
<s> It all started with UNK . </s>
<s> When it opened in UNK , UNK was the first UNK in Europe for UNK UNK flying from North America . </s>
<s> UNK in aircraft fuel efficiency over the years made a UNK stop unnecessary for most Western air UNK , but UNK still UNK inefficient UNK that ca n't make it from Moscow to UNK on one UNK . </s>
<s> As a result , Ireland did n't UNK the Soviets after they shot down a Korean Air Lines jetliner over the Sea of Japan in 1983 , though it suspended direct UNK flights for two months . </s>
<s> In fact , UNK UNK started UNK UNK from UNK to New York when Washington stripped UNK of its U.S. landing rights . </s>
<s> Today , UNK UNK is making a UNK of money from its Soviet friendship . </s>
<s> And , with those contacts in place , it could be relatively simple to add UNK UNK and UNK to the team . </s>
<s> Then , perhaps , Mr. UNK 's ideas would n't sound like so much UNK . </s>

<s> National UNK , the UNK U.S. magazine , is attracting more readers than ever and offers the UNK , UNK pages that upscale advertisers love . </s>
<s> So why did advertising pages plunge by almost 10 % and ad revenue by 7.2 % in the first half ? </s>
<s> To hear advertisers tell it , the magazine just has n't kept up with the times . </s>
<s> Despite renewed interest by the public in such topics as the environment and the Third World , it has n't been able to shake its reputation as a magazine boys like to UNK through in search of UNK UNK women . </s>
<s> Worse , it lagged behind competitors in offering UNK UNK , from regional UNK to discounts for frequent advertisers . </s>
<s> But now , the magazine is attempting to fight back , with an ambitious plan including a revamped sales strategy and a surprisingly aggressive ad campaign . </s>
<s> Advertisers do n't think of the magazine first , says Joan UNK , who joined in April as national advertising director . </s>
<s> `` What we want to do is take a more aggressive stance . </s>
<s> People did n't believe we were in tune with the marketplace , and in many ways we were n't . '' </s>
<s> The UNK magazine has never had to woo advertisers with quite so much UNK before . </s>
<s> It largely UNK on its UNK UNK : UNK million subscribers in the first half , up from 10.5 million a year ago ; an average age of 42 for readers -- at the UNK of their UNK years ; loyalty to the tune of an 85 % average UNK UNK rate . </s>
<s> The magazine had its best year yet in 1988 , when it UNK its centennial and UNK up a 17 % gain in ad pages , to UNK . </s>
<s> But this year , when the UNK surrounding its centennial died , so too did some UNK interest . </s>
<s> The reason , ad executives say , is that the entire magazine business has been soft -- and National UNK has some UNK that make it especially UNK during a soft market . </s>
<s> Perhaps the biggest of those factors is its high ad prices -- $ UNK for a UNK page , vs. $ UNK for the UNK , a comparable publication with a far smaller circulation . </s>
<s> When ad dollars are tight , the high page cost is a major UNK for advertisers , who generally want to appear regularly in a publication or not at all . </s>
<s> Even though National UNK offers far more readers than does a magazine like UNK , `` the page costs you an arm and a leg to develop any UNK , '' says Harry UNK , New York media manager for UNK Inc . </s>
<s> To combat that problem , National UNK , like other magazines , began offering regional UNK allowing advertisers to appear in only a portion of its magazines -- for example , ads can run only in the magazines sent to subscribers in the largest 25 markets . </s>
<s> But the magazine was slower than its competitors to come up with its regional UNK , and until last year offered fewer of them than did competitors . </s>
<s> Time magazine , for example , has more than 100 separate UNK going to different regions , top management , and other groups . </s>
<s> Another sticking point for advertisers was National UNK 's tradition of UNK its ads together , usually at the beginning or end of the magazine , rather than spreading ads out among its articles , as most magazines do . </s>
<s> And National UNK 's UNK size means extra production costs for advertisers . </s>
<s> But Ms. UNK says the magazine is fighting back . </s>
<s> It now offers 30 regional UNK , it very recently began running ads UNK to articles , and it has been UNK up its sales force . </s>
<s> And it just launched a promotional campaign to tell chief executives , marketing directors , and media executives just that . </s>
<s> The UNK of the promotion is its new ad campaign , into which the magazine will UNK about $ 500,000 , mostly in the next few weeks . </s>
<s> The campaign , created by UNK Group 's UNK Needham agency , takes advantage of the UNK UNK that National UNK is known for . </s>
<s> In one ad , a UNK of the UNK of the UNK in Paris is UNK with the headline , `` The only book more respected than UNK does n't accept advertising . '' </s>

<s> Should you really own stocks ? </s>
<s> That 's a question a lot of people are asking , following the stock market 's stunning display of volatility . </s>
<s> UNK financially and UNK by Friday 's UNK 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and yesterday 's UNK rebound , they 're wondering if an individual has any business being in the market . </s>
<s> The answer , say academic researchers , money managers and investment specialists , is yes -- as long as you approach the stock market as an investor . </s>
<s> But , they say , people should n't try to be traders , who buy and sell in an effort to ride the latest economic trend or catch the next hot stock . </s>
<s> The case for owning stocks over the long-term is UNK . </s>
<s> `` If you look at 75 years worth of investment history -- including the Great UNK and every bear market since -- stocks have UNK almost everything an individual could have owned by a long shot , '' says Barry Berlin , vice president at First Wachovia Capital Management . </s>
<s> A dollar invested in the stock market in UNK would have grown to $ UNK by the end of last June , according to Laurence UNK , managing director at UNK Associates Inc . </s>
<s> But a dollar invested in long-term bonds in UNK would have grown to only $ UNK , and a dollar put in Treasury bills would equal a UNK $ UNK . </s>
<s> The longer the time period , the less risk there is of losing money in the stock market . </s>
<s> Over time , the odds increasingly favor the investor with a diversified portfolio . </s>
<s> For instance , Ken UNK , a San Francisco money manager , UNK that if an investor holds a basket of stocks that tracks the Standard & Poor 's 500-stock index , the chance of losing money is 3 % to 4 % over a 10-year period , compared with 15 % over three years and 30 % over one year . </s>
<s> `` If you do n't need the money for 10 years , there 's a UNK case for sticking to a steady core of stocks , '' Mr. UNK says . </s>
<s> UNK investments also help balance the other assets an individual owns , says John UNK Jr. , president of the Institute of UNK Financial UNK . </s>
<s> Stocks have a place in an investors ' portfolio along with real estate , bonds , international securities and cash , he says . </s>
<s> There are some important UNK : Before investing in stocks , individuals should have at least three to six months of living expenses set aside in the bank , most investment advisers say . </s>
<s> Individuals also should focus on building equity in a home , which provides some protection against inflation , as well as a UNK that can be UNK in late in life to help cover the cost of retirement living . </s>
<s> People also should n't invest money in stocks that they 'll need in the near future -- for example , for college tuition payments or retirement expenses . </s>
<s> `` You may have to sell your stocks at a time when the market takes a plunge , '' says Mr. UNK , a Del UNK , Calif. financial planner . </s>
<s> But once the UNK are covered , `` then I would start to invest , even if it 's as little as $ 1,000 , '' says Michael Lipper , president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc . </s>
<s> He says individuals should consider not just stocks , but other long-term investments , such as high-quality bonds . </s>
<s> Despite the strong case for stocks , however , most pros warn that individuals should n't try to profit from short-term developments . </s>
<s> `` It 's very difficult to do , '' says Donald UNK , a market strategist for UNK Morgan Securities , a Los Angeles brokerage firm . </s>
<s> `` Our markets move so fast and they are so volatile , there 's no way the average investor can compete with the pros . '' </s>
<s> Individual investors face high transaction costs of moving in and out of the market . </s>
<s> The cost of executing stock orders UNK from brokerage to brokerage and with the size of the order , but 2 % of the order 's value is an average , says Stephen UNK , manager of T. Rowe Price 's Growth and Income mutual fund . </s>
<s> And assuming their first investment is successful , investors will have to pay taxes on their gains . </s>
<s> That can reduce returns by a third or more , once local taxes are included , Mr. Lipper says . </s>
<s> After that , individual traders face the risk that the new investment they choose wo n't perform well -- so their trading costs could be sustained for nothing . </s>
<s> `` It 's very tough for most individuals to UNK the mutual funds or the market , '' says Mr. Lipper . </s>
<s> `` You should really think twice if you think you can UNK the system . '' </s>
<s> Then , too , many individual investors lack the UNK emotional UNK professionals say is needed to plunge in and out of the market . </s>
<s> So what 's the best way to buy stocks ? </s>
<s> `` Unless an individual has a minimum of between $ 50,000 and $ 100,000 to invest in stocks , he 's still better off in mutual funds than in individual stocks , in terms of getting enough attention from a UNK broker , '' says Mr. Lipper . </s>
<s> Still , he adds , `` I could see owning both , given that individuals often have an advantage over big investors in UNK special situations based on their own UNK , '' he adds . </s>
<s> George Douglas , first vice president at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. , says that individuals have a particular edge now in `` small to UNK niche companies with exciting earnings prospects '' -- a traditional UNK ground for small investors . </s>
<s> This growth sector , which usually carries a price / earnings multiple about twice that of the Standard & Poor 's 500 , happens to include some of the market 's most attractive bargains right now . </s>
<s> `` It 's now selling at a multiple about even with the market , '' says Mr. Douglas . </s>
<s> Moreover , Mr. Douglas sees a revival of institutional interest in smaller growth stocks that could boost the performance of these stocks in the medium term . </s>
<s> Many big Wall Street brokerage firms who eliminated their research effort in stocks of emerging growth companies a few years ago are now UNK coverage of this area , he notes . </s>
<s> `` We 're seeing a real turnaround in interest in small growth stocks , '' he says . </s>
<s> The pros UNK advise individuals to stay away from the latest investment UNK . </s>
<s> They say that 's especially important this late in the growth phase of the economic cycle , when there 's no robust bull market to UNK investors out of their mistakes . </s>
<s> Friday 's correction presents `` a pretty good buying opportunity , but let 's not speculate at this point in the business cycle , '' says UNK UNK , chief equity portfolio strategist at First Boston Corp . </s>
<s> `` UNK stocks on weakness for their long-term fundamentals , '' he says . </s>
<s> In the long run , investment advisers say , most investors will be better off using the UNK averaging method of buying stocks . </s>
<s> In this method , a person UNK a regular amount every month or quarter into the stock market whether the market is up or down . </s>
<s> That cuts the risk , Mr. UNK , the San Francisco money manager , points out . </s>
<s> `` When the market is low , you are buying more shares , and when it 's high , you 're buying fewer shares , '' he says . </s>
<s> Otherwise , if you put all your money in at one time , by sheer bad luck , you might pick a terrible time , and have to wait three years to get even , Mr. UNK says . </s>
<s> A disciplined program will work the best , Mr. UNK says . </s>
<s> `` One of the hardest things to do is to buy stocks when the market is down , '' he says . </s>

<s> Of course , the relative UNK could be UNK if the market UNK again . </s>

<s> As stocks rose , in fact , some investors changed course and reversed their sell orders . </s>
<s> Many funds allow investors to UNK orders before the close of trading . </s>
<s> At UNK and at the smaller UNK funds group in UNK , Mass. , for instance , some shareholders called early in the morning to switch money from stock funds to money market funds , but later called back to reverse the UNK . </s>
<s> Because mutual fund trades do n't take effect until the market close -- in this case , at 4 p.m. -- these shareholders effectively stayed put . </s>

<s> But some investors continued to switch out of high-risk , high-yield junk funds despite yesterday 's rebound from that market 's recent price declines . </s>
<s> Shareholders have been steadily UNK out of several big junk funds the past several weeks as the $ 200 billion market was UNK by a cash crunch at Campeau Corp. and steadily declining prices . </s>
<s> Much of the money has been switched into money market funds , fund executives say . </s>
<s> Instead of selling bonds to meet UNK , however , some funds have borrowed from banks to meet withdrawal requests . </s>

<s> While not specifically mentioned in the FBI charges , dual trading became a focus of attempts to UNK industry regulations . </s>
<s> Critics contend that traders were putting buying or selling for their own accounts ahead of other traders ' customer orders . </s>
<s> Traders are likely to oppose such restrictions because dual trading provides a way to make money in slower markets where there is a shortage of customer orders . </s>
<s> The exchanges contend that dual trading improves liquidity in the markets because traders can buy or sell even when they do n't have a customer order in hand . </s>
<s> The exchanges say liquidity becomes a severe problem for UNK traded contracts such as those with a long time remaining before expiration . </s>
<s> The UNK may take those arguments into account by allowing exceptions to its restrictions . </s>
<s> The agency did n't cite specific situations where dual trading might be allowed , but smaller exchanges or contracts that need additional liquidity are expected to be among them . </s>
<s> UNK UNK , the agency 's chairman , told the Senate Agriculture Committee that she expects the study to be released within two weeks and the rule changes to be completed by UNK . </s>
<s> The study , by the UNK 's division of economic analysis , shows that `` a trade is a trade , '' a member of the study team said . </s>
<s> Whether a trade is done on a dual or UNK basis , the member said , `` does n't seem to have much economic impact . '' </s>
<s> Currently , most traders on commodity exchanges UNK in trading either for customer accounts , which makes them brokers , or for their own accounts as UNK UNK . </s>

<s> Mr. UNK has UNK the famous UNK UNK `` less is more . '' </s>
<s> His more is always less . </s>
<s> Far from being UNK , the music UNK UNK us with apparent UNK not so UNK UNK in the UNK of UNK time , UNK UNK , and UNK or UNK UNK UNK . </s>
<s> But the music has its UNK , and Mr. UNK has UNK his UNK program around a move from the simple to the relatively complex . </s>

<s> There is a UNK musical style here , but not a particular performance style . </s>
<s> The music is not especially UNK ; indeed , it 's hard to imagine a bad performance of it . </s>
<s> Nothing UNK , no UNK , no UNK UNK problems challenge the UNK . </s>
<s> We hear , we may think , inner voices , but they all seem to be saying the same thing . </s>
<s> With `` UNK News , '' music meant to UNK UNK of Allen UNK 's `` UNK UNK UNK , '' Mr. UNK gets going . </s>
<s> His hands sit UNK apart on the UNK . </s>
<s> UNK UNK make you feel as though he may break into a ( very slow ) UNK UNK . </s>
<s> The UNK UNK , but there is little UNK even though his UNK begin to UNK over more of the UNK . </s>
<s> UNK UNK UNK : First the music is UNK , then it becomes soft , then ( you realize ) it becomes UNK again . </s>
<s> `` The UNK UNK UNK , '' an UNK from `` UNK on the Beach , '' is like a UNK but it does n't seem to move much beyond its UNK ground in `` Three UNK UNK . '' </s>
<s> When Mr. UNK decides to get really fancy , he UNK his hands and hits a UNK UNK note with his right hand . </s>
<s> He does this in at least three of his UNK pieces . </s>
<s> You might call it a UNK or a UNK UNK . </s>
<s> In `` UNK UNK , '' which came from a commission to write a piece of UNK length ( Mr. UNK UNK , and UNK , UNK that `` this was no problem for me '' ) , an A section UNK with a B section several times before the piece ends UNK . </s>
<s> Not only is the typical UNK UNK , it is also often multiple in its context ( UNK ) . </s>
<s> `` UNK UNK '' began its life as the UNK to the UNK UNK 's first public address in the U.S. , when Mr. UNK played it on the UNK at New York 's UNK of St. John the UNK . </s>
<s> Later it was performed on Radio UNK in Germany , and then UNK UNK took it for one of her dance pieces . </s>
<s> The point is that any piece can be used as background music for virtually anything . </s>
<s> The evening ended with Mr. UNK 's `` UNK , '' another multiple work . </s>
<s> UNK 1 , 2 , and 5 come from the UNK of UNK Morris 's UNK film , `` The UNK Blue Line , '' and the two other parts from UNK music to two separate UNK of the UNK story of the same name . </s>
<s> When used as background in this way , the music has an appropriate UNK , as when a UNK phrase , a UNK minor third , UNK the seemingly UNK UNK of reports , interviews and UNK of witnesses in the Morris film . </s>
<s> UNK up as a UNK , however , the music lacks the UNK provided by a context within another medium . </s>
<s> UNK of Mr. UNK may agree with the critic Richard UNK 's sense that the 1974 `` UNK in UNK UNK '' is as UNK and UNK as `` The UNK UNK . '' </s>
<s> But while making the obvious point that both UNK develop variations from themes , this comparison UNK the UNK UNK nature of Mr. UNK 's music . </s>
<s> Its UNK UNK UNK UNK a UNK that makes one UNK for the UNK of UNK UNK , the UNK radical UNK of UNK and UNK , and what in UNK even seems like UNK in UNK . </s>

<s> The UNK stock market is making life tougher for small companies trying to raise money . </s>
<s> In the wake of Friday 's plunge and yesterday 's rebound , some companies are already UNK deals , and others wish they could . </s>
<s> As in other jittery times , many small businesses expect a particularly rough time raising funds as investors UNK risky deals , seeking safety in bigger companies . </s>
<s> Even if stock prices fully recover from Friday 's sharp decline , the unsettled conditions will UNK many investors . </s>
<s> `` The UNK of an unsettled situation is that the thing could drop dramatically , '' says Henry UNK Jr. , chairman of UNK Corp. , a UNK biotechnology company that is planning a private placement of stock . </s>
<s> `` The more UNK that indicate risk , the more the investor is going to drive a hard bargain . '' </s>
<s> Earlier this month , UNK Inc. , a UNK , Mass. , UNK UNK , said it would accelerate expansion plans nationwide and offer more of its stock to the public . </s>
<s> At the time , its shares were selling above their initial offering price of $ 19 , and bankers believed UNK would sell new stock without a UNK . </s>
<s> But with the company 's shares standing at $ 15 yesterday , a new offering seems unlikely , company officials say . </s>
<s> Business , however , continues to be `` robust , '' and the stock market has n't affected the concern 's expansion plans , says UNK UNK , a senior executive . </s>
<s> Other companies figure they ca n't avoid the market . </s>
<s> `` We have capital requirements , '' says Mr. UNK , `` so we have to go ahead '' with a planned $ 1.5 billion private placement . </s>
<s> Unless the market goes right back up , he says , `` it may take us six to nine months to find the money , instead of three . '' </s>
<s> And the Columbia , Md. , company may have to settle for a lower price , he adds . </s>
<s> Life is particularly UNK for companies that had planned to go public this week . </s>
<s> UNK is becoming an investment-banking job requirement . </s>
<s> Robertson , UNK & Co. , a San Francisco investment banking concern , has a client that looked forward to making its initial public offering yesterday . </s>
<s> UNK of the company , a health-care concern , `` were very UNK on Friday and felt they should n't go public ; we felt they should , '' says Sanford Robertson , partner in the banking concern . </s>
<s> As the market dropped Friday , Robertson UNK slashed the value of the offering by 7 % . </s>
<s> Yesterday , when similar securities rebounded , it UNK the valuation up again . </s>
<s> As of late yesterday , the UNK was still on . </s>
<s> For many , the situation is especially discouraging because the market for UNK was showing signs of strengthening after several years of weakness . </s>
<s> `` We were just beginning to look at the increase in UNK , seeing the light at the end of the UNK , '' says Frank UNK Jr. , partner in UNK Funds , a Beverly Hills , Calif. , venture capital concern . </s>
<s> `` But the UNK 's just gotten longer . '' </s>
<s> Companies planning to go public `` are definitely taking a second look , '' says Allen UNK , senior analyst at the Institute for UNK Research , Fort UNK , Fla. , which publishes the New Issues newsletter on UNK . </s>
<s> He UNK that the recent market slide translated into a 5 % to 7 % reduction in UNK proceeds to companies . </s>
<s> Many companies are UNK . </s>
<s> UNK Corp. had been planning to sell 10 % of its stock this week in an UNK that would raise up to $ UNK million . </s>
<s> But now , Peter UNK , president , says , `` We 're making decisions on a day-to-day basis . '' </s>
<s> UNK and profitable , the UNK , Colo. , UNK concern could borrow funds if it decides against an UNK now , he says . </s>
<s> UNK Inc. , an Atlanta UNK concern , says it is still planning to go ahead with its UNK this week or next -- unless conditions change . </s>
<s> `` It 's a UNK situation right now , '' says Terry UNK , president . </s>
<s> UNK financings also would affect the operations of many companies . </s>
<s> Sierra Tucson Cos. , a Tucson , Ariz. , operator of UNK centers , has a planned doubling of capacity riding on an UNK scheduled for next week . </s>
<s> William UNK , president , says he still thinks the UNK will succeed . </s>
<s> If it does n't , he says , the company would have to change its expansion timetable . </s>
<s> But the market turmoil could be partially beneficial for some small businesses . </s>
<s> In a sagging market , the Federal Reserve System `` might flood the market with funds , and that should bring interest rates down , '' says Leonard T. UNK , vice president of the Bank of New England , Boston . </s>
<s> James G. UNK , president of UNK Savings Bank , UNK , Mass. , says the market turmoil `` is an UNK UNK for small business . '' </s>
<s> For small companies , he says , interest rates are far more important than what happens on stock exchanges . </s>
<s> Mr. UNK thinks rates are heading down , helping small companies . </s>
<s> Peter UNK , biotechnology analyst for UNK Securities International , Chicago , thinks market uncertainty may encourage small companies to form more strategic alliances with big corporations . </s>
<s> UNK because the 1987 market crash made it harder for them to find financing , many high-technology concerns have made such alliances recently . </s>
<s> Some even see a silver UNK in the dark clouds . </s>
<s> Alan Wells , president of UNK , Wells , UNK & Co. , a New York merger specialist , thinks UNK investors may lose their enthusiasm for leveraged buy-out and giant takeover deals . </s>
<s> Instead , they could turn to investing in smaller deals involving smaller companies , he says . </s>
<s> And William E. UNK Jr. , a University of New Hampshire management professor and director of Venture Capital Network Inc. , says the market 's gyrations will UNK the investors ' lack of control in big stock investments . </s>
<s> This will add to the appeal of small business , he says , where investors often have a degree of influence . </s>
<s> Once again , your editorial page UNK the law to conform to your almost UNK UNK . </s>
<s> In an UNK of little UNK to his central point about private enforcement suits by environmental groups , Michael S. UNK UNK your readers , `` ... the Clean Water Act is written upon the UNK -- the UNK , rather -- that nothing but zero risk will do ; it UNK a legal standard of zero UNK '' ( `` UNK Environmental UNK , '' Sept. 18 ) . </s>
<s> This statement surely UNK your editorial UNK that environmental protection is generally silly or excessive , but it is simply wrong . </s>
<s> The Clean Water Act contains no `` legal standard '' of zero UNK . </s>
<s> It requires that `` UNK of UNK '' into the `` waters of the United States '' be authorized by permits that reflect the UNK limitations developed under section UNK . </s>
<s> Whatever may be the problems with this system , it UNK reflects `` zero risk '' or `` zero UNK . '' </s>
<s> Perhaps Mr. UNK was confused by Congress 's UNK statement of `` the national goal '' in section 101 , which indeed calls for the elimination of UNK -- by 1985 , no less . </s>
<s> This UNK statement was not taken seriously when enacted in 1972 , and should not now be confused with the UNK provisions of the statute . </s>
<s> Thus , you do the public a great UNK when Mr. UNK suggests , even UNK , that the Clean Water Act prohibits the preparation of a UNK and water ; your UNK readers may be led to believe that nothing but chance or oversight protects them , as they UNK in the night with their UNK and waters , from the UNK UNK of the Sierra Club at their doors . </s>

<s> Two weeks ago , viewers of several NBC UNK consumer segments started calling a 900 number for advice on various UNK issues . </s>
<s> And the new UNK `` reality '' show `` UNK UNK '' records viewers ' opinions for possible airing on the next day 's show . </s>

<s> Blair Entertainment , a New York firm that advises TV stations and sells ads for them , has just formed a subsidiary -- 900 Blair -- to apply the technology to television . </s>
<s> The use of 900 toll numbers has been expanding rapidly in recent years . </s>
<s> For a while , UNK UNK lines and services that UNK children to UNK ( and UNK ) movie or music information earned the service a somewhat UNK image , but new legal restrictions are aimed at UNK UNK . </s>
<s> The cost of a 900 call is set by the UNK -- ABC Sports , for example -- with the UNK starting at 75 cents . </s>
<s> UNK is included in a UNK 's regular phone bill . </s>
<s> From the fee , the local phone company and the long-distance carrier UNK their costs to carry the call , passing the rest of the money to the UNK , which must cover advertising and other costs . </s>
<s> In recent months , the technology has become more flexible and able to handle much more volume . </s>
<s> Before , UNK of 900 numbers would just listen and not talk , or they 'd vote `` yes '' or `` no '' by calling one of two numbers . </s>
<s> ( People in the phone business call this technology `` 900 UNK . '' ) </s>
<s> Now , UNK are led through complex UNK of choices to UNK information they want , and the hardware can process 10,000 calls in 90 seconds . </s>
<s> Up to now , 900 numbers have mainly been used on local TV stations and cable channels . </s>

<s> For several years , Turner Broadcasting System 's Cable News Network has invited viewers to respond UNK to UNK issues ( `` Should the U.S. military UNK in Panama ? '' ) , but even the hottest UNK on UNK UNK only about 10,000 calls . </s>
<s> The newest uses of the UNK technology demonstrate the growing variety of applications . </s>
<s> Capital Cities / ABC Inc. , CBS Inc. and General Electric Co. 's National Broadcasting Co. unit are expected to announce soon a joint campaign to raise awareness about UNK . </s>
<s> The subject will be written into the UNK of prime-time shows , and viewers will be given a 900 number to call . </s>
<s> UNK will be sent educational UNK , and the call 's modest cost will be an immediate method of raising money . </s>
<s> Other network applications have very different goals . </s>
<s> ABC Sports was looking for ways to lift UNK UNK ratings for `` Monday Night Football . '' </s>
<s> UNK UNK , ABC Sports 's marketing director , says that now `` tens of thousands '' of fans call its 900 number each week to vote for the best UNK return , UNK UNK , UNK . </s>
<s> Profit from the calls goes to charity , but ABC Sports also uses the calls as a sales tool : After UNK UNK for voting , Frank UNK offers a football UNK for $ UNK , and 5 % of UNK stay on the line to order it . </s>
<s> UNK may be sold next . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , NBC Sports recently began `` UNK UNK , '' a UNK , UNK 900 line providing a complex array of scores , analysis and fan news . </s>
<s> A spokesman said its purpose is `` to bolster the impression that NBC Sports is always there for people . '' </s>
<s> NBC 's `` UNK '' consumer minutes have increased UNK spending during the day , the network 's UNK period . </s>
<s> Each UNK matches a sponsor and a topic : On UNK , Unilever N.V. 's UNK Bros. sponsors UNK on UNK and exercise , followed by a UNK UNK Bros. commercial . </s>
<s> UNK can call a 900 number for additional advice , which will be UNK to their needs based on the numbers they UNK ( `` Press one if you 're pregnant , '' UNK . ) . </s>
<s> If the UNK stays on the line and leaves a name and address for the sponsor , coupons and a newsletter will be UNK , and the sponsor will be able to gather a list of desirable potential customers . </s>

<s> `` These are just baby steps toward real UNK video , which I believe will be the biggest thing yet to affect television , '' he says . </s>
