<s> Thursday 's report on the September consumer price index is expected *-1 to rise , although not as sharply as the 0.9 % gain reported * Friday in the producer price index . </s>
<s> That gain was being cited *-1 as a reason 0 the stock market was down early in Friday 's session , before it got *-2 started *-2 on its reckless 190-point plunge *T*-3 . </s>
<s> Economists are divided *-1 as to how much manufacturing strength they expect *-2 to see *T*-3 in September reports on industrial production and capacity utilization , also due tomorrow . </s>
<s> Meanwhile , September housing starts , due Wednesday , are thought * to have inched upward . </s>
<s> `` There 's a possibility of a surprise '' in the trade report , said 0 *T*-1 Michael Englund , director of research at MMS . </s>
<s> A widening of the deficit , if it were combined *-1 with a stubbornly strong dollar , would exacerbate trade problems -- but the dollar weakened Friday as stocks plummeted . </s>
<s> In any event , Mr. Englund and many others say that the easy gains in * narrowing the trade gap have already been made *-1 . </s>
<s> `` Trade is definitely going *-3 to be more politically sensitive over the next six or seven months as improvement begins *-1 to slow , '' he said *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Exports are thought *-1 to have risen strongly in August , but probably not enough * to offset the jump in imports , economists said *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Views on manufacturing strength are split between economists who *T*-1 read September 's low level of factory job growth as a sign of a slowdown and those who *T*-2 use the somewhat more comforting total employment figures in their calculations . </s>
<s> The wide range of estimates for the industrial output number underscores the differences : The forecasts run from a drop of 0.5 % to an increase of 0.4 % , according to MMS . </s>
<s> A rebound in energy prices , which *T*-1 helped push up the producer price index , is expected *-2 to do the same in the consumer price report . </s>
<s> The consensus view expects a 0.4 % increase in the September CPI after a flat reading in August . </s>
<s> Robert H. Chandross , an economist for Lloyd 's Bank in New York , is among those expecting a more moderate gain in the CPI than in prices at the producer level . </s>
<s> `` Auto prices had a big effect in the PPI , and at the CPI level they wo n't *?* , '' he said *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Food prices are expected *-2 to be unchanged , but energy costs jumped as much as 4 % , said 0 *T*-1 Gary Ciminero , economist at Fleet\/Norstar Financial Group . </s>
<s> He also says 0 he thinks 0 `` core inflation , '' which *T*-1 excludes the volatile food and energy prices , was strong last month . </s>

<s> Housing starts are expected * to quicken a bit from August 's annual pace of 1,350,000 units . </s>

<s> `` Capital City '' is a weekly series that *T*-1 premiered here three weeks ago amid unprecedented hype by its producer , Thames Television . </s>
<s> The early episodes make you long for a rerun of the crash of 1987 . </s>
<s> * Let 's make that 1929 , just * to be sure . </s>
<s> According to the program 's publicity prospectus , `` Capital City , '' set at Shane Longman , a fictional mid-sized securities firm with # 500 million *U* capital , `` follows the fortunes of a close-knit team of young , high-flying dealers , hired * for their particular blend of style , genius and energy . </s>
<s> But with all the money and glamour of high finance come *T*-1 the relentless pressures * to do well ; pressure * to pull off another million before lunch ; pressure * to anticipate the market by a fraction of a second ... '' </s>
<s> You need n't be a high-powered securities lawyer * to realize 0 the prospectus is guilty of less than full disclosure . </s>
<s> The slickly produced series has been criticized *-1 by London 's financial cognoscenti as inaccurate in detail , but its major weakness is its unrealistic depiction of the characters ' professional and private lives . </s>
<s> *-1 Turned loose in Shane Longman 's trading room , the yuppie dealers do little right . </s>
<s> * Judging by the money lost * and mistakes made * in the early episodes , Shane Longman 's capital should be just about exhausted by the final 13th week . </s>
<s> In the opening episode we learn that Michelle , a junior bond trader , has indeed pulled off another million before lunch . </s>
<s> Trouble is , 0 she has lost it just as quickly . </s>
<s> Rather than *-1 keep the loss a secret from the outside world , Michelle blabs about it to a sandwich man while * ordering lunch over the phone . </s>
<s> Little chance that Shane Longman is going *-1 to recoup today . </s>
<s> Traders spend the morning * frantically selling bonds , in the belief that the U.S. monthly trade figures will look lousy . </s>
<s> Ah , perfidious Columbia ! </s>
<s> The trade figures turn out well , and all those recently unloaded bonds spurt in price . </s>
<s> So much for * anticipating the market by a fraction of a second . </s>
<s> And a large slice of the first episode is devoted *-1 to efforts * to get rid of some nearly worthless Japanese bonds -LRB- since when is anything Japanese nearly worthless nowadays *T*-3 ? -RRB- . </s>
<s> Surprisingly , Shane Longman survives the week , only * to have a senior executive innocently bumble his way into * becoming the target of a criminal insider trading investigation . </s>
<s> Instead of * closing ranks * to protect the firm 's reputation , the executive 's internal rivals , led * by a loutish American , demand his resignation . </s>
<s> The plot is thwarted *-1 when the firm 's major stockholder , kelp farming on the other side of the globe , hurries home * to support the executive *T*-3 . </s>
<s> But the investigation continues . </s>
<s> If you can swallow the premise that the rewards for such ineptitude are six-figure salaries , you still are left *-1 puzzled , because few of the yuppies consume very conspicuously . </s>
<s> In fact , few consume much of anything . </s>
<s> Two share a house almost devoid of furniture . </s>
<s> Michelle lives in a hotel room , and although she drives a canary-colored Porsche , she has n't time 0 * to clean or repair it *T*-3 ; the beat-up vehicle can be started *-1 only with a huge pair of pliers because the ignition key has broken off in the lock . </s>
<s> And it *EXP*-1 takes Declan , the obligatory ladies ' man of the cast , until the third episode * to get past first base with any of his prey . </s>
<s> Perhaps the explanation for these anomalies is that class-conscious Britain is n't ready * to come to terms with the wealth created * by the Thatcherian free-enterprise regime . </s>
<s> After all , this is n't old money , but new money , and in many cases , young money . </s>
<s> This attitude is clearly illustrated *-1 in the treatment of Max , the trading room 's most flamboyant character . </s>
<s> Yuppily enough , he lives in a lavishly furnished converted church , wears designer clothes and drives an antique car . </s>
<s> But apparently * to make him palatable , even lovable , to the masses , the script inflates pony-tailed Max into an eccentric genius , master of 11 Chinese dialects . </s>
<s> He takes his wash to the laundromat , where he meets a punky French girl who *T*-1 dupes him into * providing a home for her pet piranha and then promptly steals his car and dumps it in Dieppe *T*-3 . </s>
<s> In * producing and promoting `` Capital City , '' Thames has spent about as much as Shane Longman loses on a good day . </s>
<s> The production costs are a not inconsiderable # 8 million *U* -LRB- $ 12.4 million *U* -RRB- , and would have been much higher had not the cost of the trading floor set been absorbed in the budget of `` Dealers , '' an earlier made-for-TV movie . </s>
<s> Another half million quid went for a volley of full-page advertisements in six major British newspapers and for huge posters in the London subway . </s>
<s> These expenses create a special incentive for `` Capital City 's '' producers to flog it , or a Yank-oriented version of it , in America . </s>
<s> Thames 's U.S. marketing agent , Donald Taffner , is preparing *-1 to do just that . </s>
<s> He is discreetly hopeful , * citing three U.S. comedy series -- `` Three 's Company , '' `` Too Close for Comfort '' and `` * Check It Out '' -- that *T*-1 had British antecedents . </s>
<s> Perhaps without *-1 realizing it , Mr. Taffner simultaneously has put his finger on the problem and an ideal solution : `` Capital City '' should have been a comedy , a worthy sequel to the screwball British `` Carry On '' movies of the 1960s . </s>
<s> The seeds already are in the script . </s>
<s> The first episode concluded with a marvelously cute scene in which the trading-room crew minded a baby , the casualty of a broken marriage at the firm *T*-2 . </s>
<s> And many in the young cast bear striking resemblances to American TV and movie personalities known * for light roles . </s>
<s> Joanna Kanska looks like a young Zsa Zsa Gabor ; William Armstrong , who *T*-1 plays Max , could pass for Hans Conreid , and Douglas Hodge -LRB- Declan -RRB- for James Farentino ; Rolf Saxon is a passable Tommy Noonan and Dorian Healy could easily double for Huntz Hall , the blank-faced foil of the Bowery Boys comedies . </s>
<s> So , OK kids , everybody *?* on stage for `` * Carry On *-2 Trading '' : The cast is frantically searching the office for misplaced Japanese bonds that suddenly *T*-1 have soared in value because Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank has just bought the White House . </s>
<s> The pressure is too much for Zsa Zsa , who *T*-1 slaps a security guard . </s>
<s> He backflips into a desktop computer terminal , which *T*-1 explodes , *-2 covering Huntz Hall 's face with microchips . </s>
<s> And all the while , the bonds are in the baby 's diaper . </s>
<s> It should run forever . </s>

<s> Axa-Midi Assurances of France gave details of its financing plans for its proposed $ 4.5 billion *U* acquisition of Farmers Group Inc. , in amended filings with insurance regulators in the nine U.S. states where Farmers operates *T*-1 . </s>
<s> The proposed acquisition is part of Sir James Goldsmith 's unfriendly takeover attempt for B.A.T Industries PLC , the British tobacco , retailing , paper and financial services concern that *T*-1 is parent of Los Angeles-based Farmers . </s>
<s> In an attempt * to appease U.S. regulators ' concern over a Goldsmith acquisition of Farmers , Sir James in August agreed *-1 to sell Farmers to Axa if he is successful in *-2 acquiring B.A.T . </s>
<s> As part of the agreement , Axa agreed *-1 to invest $ 1 billion *U* in Hoylake Investments Ltd. , Sir James 's acquisition vehicle . </s>
<s> Of the total $ 5.5 billion *U* 0 *T*-4 to be paid *-3 to Hoylake by Axa , about $ 1 billion *U* *T*-1 will come from available resources of Axa 's parent , Axa-Midi Group , $ 2.25 billion *U* *T*-1 will be in the form of notes issued * by Axa , and the remaining $ 2.25 billion *U* *T*-1 will be in long-term bank loans . </s>
<s> In an interview Thursday , Claude Bebear , chairman and chief executive officer of Axa , said 0 his group has already obtained assurances *ICH*-1 from a group of banks led * by Cie . Financiere de Paribas that they can provide the loan portion of the financing . </s>
<s> The other banking companies in the group are Credit Lyonnais , Societe Generale , BankAmerica Corp. and Citicorp , he said 0 *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Mr. Bebear said 0 Axa-Midi Group has `` more than $ 2.5 billion *U* of non-strategic assets that we can and will sell '' *T*-1 *-2 to help *-3 pay off debt from the acquisition . </s>
<s> He said 0 the assets 0 *T*-2 to be sold *-3 would be `` non-insurance '' assets , including a beer company and a real estate firm , and would n't include any pieces of Farmers . </s>
<s> `` We wo n't put any burden on Farmers , '' he said *T*-1 . </s>
<s> The amended filings also point out that under a new agreement , Hoylake has an absolute obligation * to sell Farmers to Axa upon an acquisition of B.A.T . </s>
<s> `` We hope that with what we did *T*-1 , the regulators will not need *-2 to evaluate Hoylake , and they can directly look at the agreement with us , because Hoylake wo n't be an owner of Farmers at anytime , '' Mr. Bebear said *T*-3 . </s>
<s> Any change of control in Farmers needs approval of the insurance commissioners in the nine states where Farmers and its related companies are incorporated *-1 *T*-2 . </s>
<s> The amended filings were required *-1 because of the new agreement between Axa and Hoylake , and * to reflect the extension that Sir James received *T*-2 last month under British takeover rules * to complete his proposed acquisition . </s>
<s> Hoylake dropped its initial # 13.35 billion *U* -LRB- $ 20.71 billion *U* -RRB- takeover bid after it received the extension , but said 0 it would launch a new bid if and when the propsed sale of Farmers to Axa receives regulatory approval *T*-1 . </s>
<s> A spokesman for B.A.T said of the amended filings that , `` It would appear that nothing substantive has changed . </s>
<s> The new financing structure is still a very-highly leveraged one , and Axa still plans *-1 to take out 75 % of Farmers ' earnings as dividends *-2 to service their debt . '' </s>
<s> That dividend is almost double the 35 % currently taken out of Farmers by B.A.T , the spokesman added 0 *T*-1 . </s>
<s> `` It would have severe implications for Farmers ' policy holders . '' </s>
<s> *-2 To fend off Sir James 's advances , B.A.T has proposed a sweeping restructuring that *T*-1 would pare it to a tobacco and financial services concern . </s>
<s> Dismal sales at General Motors Corp. dragged the U.S. car and truck market down below year-ago levels in early October , the first sales period of the 1990 model year . </s>
<s> The eight major domestic auto makers sold 160,510 North American-made cars in the first 10 days of October , a 12.6 % drop from a year earlier . </s>
<s> Domestically built truck sales were down 10.4 % to 86,555 pickups , vans and sport utility vehicles . </s>
<s> The heavy use of incentives * to clear out 1989 models appears *-2 to have taken the steam , at least initially , out of 1990 model sales , which *T*-1 began officially Oct. 1 . </s>
<s> This appears particularly true at GM , which *T*-1 had strong sales in August and September but saw its early October car and truck results fall 26.3 % from last year 's unusually high level . </s>
<s> Overall , sales of all domestic-made vehicles fell 11.9 % from a year ago . </s>
<s> Without GM , overall sales for the other U.S. automakers were roughly flat with 1989 results . </s>
<s> Some of the U.S. auto makers have already adopted incentives on many 1990 models , but they may have * to broaden their programs *-1 to keep sales up . </s>
<s> `` We 've created a condition where , without incentives , it 's a tough market *T*-2 , '' said *T*-1 Tom Kelly , sales manager for Bill Wink Chevrolet in Dearborn , Mich . </s>
<s> Car sales fell to a seasonally adjusted annual selling rate of 5.8 million vehicles , the lowest since October 1987 . </s>
<s> The poor performance contrasts with a robust selling rate of almost eight million last month . </s>
<s> Furthermore , dealers contacted late last week said 0 they could n't see any immediate impact on sales of Friday 's steep market decline . </s>
<s> GM 's domestic car sales dropped 24.3 % and its domestic trucks were down an even steeper 28.7 % from the same period a year ago . </s>
<s> All of the GM divisions except Cadillac showed big declines . </s>
<s> Cadillac posted a 3.2 % increase despite new competition from Lexus , the fledging luxury-car division of Toyota Motor Corp . </s>
<s> Lexus sales were n't available ; the cars are imported *-1 and Toyota reports their sales only at month-end . </s>
<s> The sales drop for the No. 1 car maker may have been caused *-3 in part by the end in September of dealer incentives that GM offered *T*-1 in addition to consumer rebates and low-interest financing , a company spokesman said 0 *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Last year , GM had a different program *ICH*-3 in place that *T*-2 continued *-4 rewarding dealers until all the 1989 models had been sold *-1 . </s>
<s> Aside from GM , other car makers posted generally mixed results . </s>
<s> Ford Motor Co. had a 1.8 % drop in domestic car sales but a 2.4 % increase in domestic truck sales . </s>
<s> Chrysler Corp. had a 7.5 % drop in car sales , * echoing its generally slow performance all year . </s>
<s> However , sales of trucks , including the company 's popular minivans , rose 4.3 % . </s>
<s> Honda Motor Co. 's sales of domestically built vehicles plunged 21.7 % from a year earlier . </s>
<s> Honda 's plant in Marysville , Ohio , was gearing up * to build 1990 model Accords , a Honda spokesman said 0 *T*-1 . </s>
<s> `` We 're really confident 0 everything will bounce back to normal , '' he added *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Separately , Chrysler said 0 firm prices on its 1990-model domestic cars and minivans will rise an average of 5 % over comparably equipped 1989 models . </s>
<s> Firm prices were generally in line with the tentative prices announced * earlier this fall . </s>
<s> At that time , Chrysler said 0 base prices , which *T*-2 are n't adjusted *-1 for equipment changes , would rise between 4 % and 9 % *U* on most vehicle . </s>
<s> a - Totals include only vehicle sales reported * in period . </s>
<s> c - Domestic car </s>

<s> Now , the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital . </s>
<s> Employees held an open house *-1 to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` Szabad Europa Radio '' -- Radio Free Europe . </s>
<s> `` I think 0 this is a victory for the radio , '' says *T*-2 Barnabas de Bueky , a 55-year-old former Hungarian refugee who *T*-1 works in the Munich , West Germany , headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service . </s>
<s> In fact , the network hopes *-2 to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that *T*-1 will have it . </s>
<s> But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one . </s>
<s> In fact , Radio Free Europe is in danger of *-1 suffering from its success . </s>
<s> While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest , so can *?* *T*-1 others . </s>
<s> In addition , competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when * broadcasting here was strictly controlled *-3 *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Instead of *-2 being denounced *-1 as an evil agent of imperialism , Radio Free Europe is more likely * to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring . </s>
<s> `` They have a lot 0 * to do *T*-2 these days * to compete with Hungarian radio , '' says *T*-1 Andrew Deak , a computer-science student at the Technical University in Budapest . </s>
<s> `` The Hungarian -LCB- radio -RCB- reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what *T*-1 's going on here . '' </s>
<s> Indeed , Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion . </s>
<s> Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe . </s>
<s> Newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines . </s>
<s> Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder . </s>
<s> The British Broadcasting Corp. and the U.S. State Department 's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves , though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian . </s>
<s> Australian press magnate Rupert Murdoch has bought 50 % stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers , while Britain 's Robert Maxwell has let it *EXP*-2 be known *-1 here that he is thinking about similar moves . </s>
<s> But Radio Free Europe does n't plan *-1 to fade away . </s>
<s> With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says 0 it still has plenty 0 * to do *T*-1 -- in Hungary and in the `` Great Eastern Beyond . '' </s>
<s> Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union , Radio Liberty , say 0 they wo n't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts . </s>
<s> They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues : from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz . </s>
<s> The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe . </s>
<s> Months before the decision *ICH*-1 by the Hungarian Communist Party * to rename itself Socialist and try *-2 to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying *-3 to look more hospitable . </s>
<s> It *EXP*-1 proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission * to set up office . </s>
<s> Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says *T*-2 Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who *T*-1 helped *-3 organize the Budapest location . </s>
<s> `` That is a miracle . '' </s>
<s> It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which *T*-1 had *-3 to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents -LRB- who *T*-2 filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters -RRB- . </s>
<s> In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian listeners say 0 they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for * keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls *T*-1 the `` Dark Ages of the 20th Century . '' </s>
<s> `` During the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night * listening to our radios , '' says *T*-1 the writer . </s>
<s> `` There were some very brave broadcasts . '' </s>
<s> The listeners , too , had *-1 to be brave . </s>
<s> Through much of the post-World War II period , * listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary . </s>
<s> `` When we listen to the Europe station *T*-1 , my mother still gets nervous , '' says *T*-2 a Budapest translator . </s>
<s> `` She wants *-1 to turn down the volume and close the curtains . '' </s>
<s> Now , the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the late-night slot . </s>
<s> Hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight . </s>
<s> Television , which most of the time *T*-3 is considered *-1 rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , `` The End of the Day , '' which *T*-2 comes on after 11 p.m . </s>
<s> It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who *T*-1 discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs . </s>
<s> Those who *T*-1 want *-2 to hear even more radical views have *-3 to get up at five on Sunday morning for `` Sunday Journal , '' on Hungarian Radio . </s>
<s> The competitive spirit is clearly influencing Radio Free Europe , which *T*-1 is trying *-2 to beef up programs . </s>
<s> The Budapest office plans *-1 to hire free-lance reporters * to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east . </s>
<s> The Hungarian service has a daily 40-minute news show called * Newsreel , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world . </s>
<s> There 's also a host of new programs , trying * to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics . </s>
<s> A daily 35-minute program called * `` The March of Time '' tries *-1 to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world . </s>
<s> There 's a program for women and a science show . </s>
<s> And * to attract younger listeners , Radio Free Europe intersperses the latest in Western rock groups . </s>
<s> The Pet Shop Boys are big this year in Budapest . </s>
<s> `` We are starving for all the news , '' says *T*-1 Mr. Deak , the student . </s>
<s> `` Every moment we want *-1 to know everything about the world . </s>
<s> Proposals for government-operated `` national service , '' like influenza , flare up from time to time , depress the resistance of the body politic , run their course , and seem *-1 to disappear , only * to mutate and afflict public life anew . </s>
<s> The disease metaphor comes to mind , of course , not as an aspersion on the advocates of national service . </s>
<s> Rather , it is born *-1 of frustration with * having *-3 to combat constantly changing strains of a statist idea that one thought 0 *T*-4 had been eliminated *-2 in the early 1970s , along with smallpox . </s>
<s> It is back with us again , in the form of legislation * to pay volunteers under a `` National and Community Service Act , '' a proposal with a serious shot at congressional passage this fall . </s>
<s> Why does the national-service virus keep coming back *T*-1 ? </s>
<s> Perhaps it is because utopian nostalgia evokes both military experience and the social gospel . </s>
<s> If only we could get America 's wastrel youth into at least a psychic uniform we might be able * to teach self-discipline again and revive the spirit of giving . </s>
<s> A quarter of a century ago national service was promoted *-1 as a way of * curing the manifest inequities of the draft -- by , of all things , * expanding the draft . </s>
<s> Those of us who *T*-1 resisted the idea then suspect today that an obligation of government service for all young people is still the true long-term aim of many national-service backers , despite their protests that present plans contain no coercion . </s>
<s> Choice of the volunteer military in the 1970s seemed *-1 to doom national service as much as the draft . </s>
<s> But the virus was kept *-1 alive in sociology departments until a couple of years ago , when it again was let *-2 loose *T*-3 . </s>
<s> This time it attempted *-1 to invade two connected problems , the rising cost of higher education and the rising expense to the federal government of educational grants and loans . </s>
<s> Why not * keep *RNR*-1 and even expand *RNR*-1 the loans and grants , the advocates reasoned *T*-2 , but * require some form of service from each recipient ? </s>
<s> Military service , moreover , could be a national-service option . </s>
<s> Thus , undoubtedly it *EXP*-2 was hoped *-1 that the new strain of national service would prove contagious , * infecting patriotic conservatives , pay-as-you-go moderates , and idealistic liberals . </s>
<s> The Democratic Leadership Council , a centrist group sponsoring the plan , surely thought 0 it might help the party to attract support , especially among college students and their parents . </s>
<s> A provision allowing grants *-2 to be applied *-2 to first-home purchases was added *-1 * to appeal to those who *T*-3 had had enough of schooling . </s>
<s> The DLC plan envisaged `` volunteers '' planting trees *RNR*-1 , emptying bedpans *RNR*-1 , tutoring children *RNR*-1 , and assisting librarians *RNR*-1 for $ 100 *U* a week , tax free , plus medical care . </s>
<s> With a tax-free $ 10,000 *U* voucher payment at the end of each year , the volunteers would be making a wage comparable to $ 17,500 *U* a year . </s>
<s> Mind you , most of `` the volunteers '' would be unskilled 17 - to 18-year-olds , some not even high school graduates , and many saving money by *-1 living at home . </s>
<s> They would be doing better financially under national service than many taxpayers working at the same kinds of jobs and perhaps supporting families . </s>
<s> As it happened , political resistance developed among educational and minority interests that *T*-1 count on the present education grant system , so the national-service devotees decided *-2 to abandon the supposedly crucial principle of `` * give in order * to get . '' </s>
<s> Opposition to national service from the Pentagon , which *T*-2 wants *-3 to protect its own recruitment process , also led to the military-service option being dropped *-1 . </s>
<s> Clearly , a new rationale for national service had *-1 to be cooked up . </s>
<s> What better place 0 * to turn *T*-3 than Sen. Edward Kennedy 's Labor Committee , that great stove of government expansionism , where many a stagnant pot of porridge is kept *-1 on the back burner until it can be brought forward and presented as nouvelle cuisine *T*-2 ? </s>
<s> In this case , the new recipe for national service called for * throwing many assorted legislative leftovers into one kettle : a demonstration project for educational aid -LRB- particularly satisfying to the DLC and Sen. Sam Nunn -RRB- , a similar demonstration program for youth conservation -LRB- a la Sen. Chris Dodd -RRB- , a competitive grants program to states 0 *T*-1 to spark youth and senior citizen volunteer projects -LRB- a Kennedy specialty -RRB- , a community service work-study program for students -LRB- pleasing to the palate of Sen. Dale Bumpers , among others -RRB- , plus engorgement of the VISTA volunteer program and the Retired Senior Volunteer , Foster Grandparent , and Senior Companion programs . </s>
<s> Before the menu is printed *-1 , the House may add more ingredients , also * changing the initial price , now posted at some $ 330 million *U* . </s>
<s> It is widely known *-1 that `` too many cooks spoil the broth , '' but that wisdom does not necessarily reflect the view of the cooks , especially if they are senators . </s>
<s> The `` omnibus '' bill coming out of Congress may be unwholesome glop , but the assorted chefs are happy and the restaurant is pushing the dish very hard . </s>
<s> The aroma of patronage is in the air . </s>
<s> Is the voluntary sector so weak that it needs such unsolicited assistance ? </s>
<s> On the contrary , it is as robust as ever . </s>

<s> What is one *-2 to think *T*-1 of all this ? </s>
<s> Doctrine and special interests govern some responses . </s>
<s> People eager * to have youth `` pay their dues to society '' favor service proposals -- preferably mandatory ones . </s>
<s> So do *T*-2 those who *T*-1 seek a `` re-energized concept of citizenship , '' a concept imposing stern obligations as well as conferring rights . </s>
<s> Then there are instinctive opponents . </s>
<s> To libertarians , mandatory service is an abomination and voluntary systems are illegitimate uses of tax money . </s>
<s> Devotees of the market question the value of the work 0 national service would perform *T*-1 : </s>
<s> If the market wo n't pay for it , they argue , it ca n't be worth its cost . </s>
<s> Elements of the left are also reflexively opposed *-1 ; they see service as a cover for the draft , or fear the regimentation of youth , or want *-2 to see rights enlarged *-3 , not obligations *?* *-4 . </s>
<s> But what about those of us whose views *T*-2 are not predetermined *-1 by formula or ideology ? </s>
<s> How should we think about national service *T*-1 ? </s>
<s> * Let 's begin by *-1 recognizing a main source of confusion -- `` national service '' has no agreed meaning . </s>
<s> Would service be voluntary or compulsory ? </s>
<s> Short or long ? </s>
<s> Part-time or full-time ? </s>
<s> Paid or unpaid ? </s>
<s> Would participants live at home and work nearby or live in barracks and work on public lands ? </s>
<s> What kinds of work would they do *T*-1 ? </s>
<s> What does `` national '' mean *T*-1 ? </s>
<s> Would the program be run by the federal government , by local governments , or by private voluntary organizations ? </s>
<s> And who *T*-1 would serve ? </s>
<s> Only males , as with the draft , or both sexes ? </s>
<s> Youth only or all ages ? </s>
<s> Middle-class people , or poor people , or a genuine cross-section ? </s>
<s> Many or few ? </s>
<s> Those are not trivial questions , and the label `` national service '' answers none of them . </s>
<s> Then how should we think about national service *T*-1 ? </s>
<s> As a starting point , here are five propositions : 1 . * Consider the ingredients , not the name . </s>
<s> * Ignore `` national service '' in the abstract ; * consider specific proposals . </s>
<s> They will differ in crucial ways . </s>
<s> 2 . `` Service '' should be service . </s>
<s> As * commonly understood *-1 , service implies sacrifice . </s>
<s> It involves * accepting risk , or * giving up income , or * deferring a career . </s>
<s> It follows that proposals like Nunn-McCurdy , whose benefits to enrollees *T*-1 are worth some $ 17,500 *U* a year , do not qualify . </s>
<s> There is a rationale for such bills : Federal subsidies to college students amount to `` a GI Bill without the GI '' ; arguably those benefits should be earned *-1 , not given *-1 . </s>
<s> But the earnings exceed by 20 % the average income of young high-school graduates with full-time jobs . </s>
<s> Why * call that service ? </s>
<s> 3 . Encouragement is fine ; compulsion is not *?* . </s>
<s> Compelled service is unconstitutional . </s>
<s> It is also unwise and unenforceable . </s>
<s> -LRB- Who *T*-1 will throw several hundred thousand refusers in jail each year ? -RRB- </s>
<s> But through tax policy and in other ways the federal government encourages many kinds of behavior . </s>
<s> It should also encourage service -- preferably by all classes and all ages . </s>
<s> Its encouragement should strengthen *RNR*-1 and not undercut *RNR*-1 the strong tradition of volunteering in the U.S. , should build on the service programs already in existence , and should honor local convictions about which tasks *T*-2 most need doing . </s>
<s> 4 . Good programs are not cheap . </s>
<s> Enthusiasts assume that national service would get important work done cheaply : forest fires fought *-1 , housing rehabilitated *-2 , students tutored *-3 , day-care centers staffed *-4 . </s>
<s> There is important work 0 *T*-3 to be done *-1 , and existing service and conservation corps have shown that even youths who *T*-2 start with few skills can do much of it well -- but not cheaply . </s>
<s> Good service programs require recruitment , screening , training and supervision -- all of high quality . </s>
<s> They involve stipends to participants . </s>
<s> Full-time residential programs also require housing and full-time supervision ; they are particularly expensive -- more per participant than a year at Stanford or Yale . </s>
<s> Non-residential programs are cheaper , but good ones still come to some $ 10,000 *U* a year . </s>
<s> Are they worth that ? </s>
<s> Evaluations suggest that good ones are *?* -- especially so if the effects on participants are counted *-1 . </s>
<s> But the calculations are challengeable . </s>
<s> 5 . Underclass youth are a special concern . </s>
<s> Are such expenditures worthwhile , then ? </s>
<s> Yes , if * targeted *-1 . </s>
<s> People of all ages and all classes should be encouraged *-1 to serve , but there are many ways for middle-class kids , and their elders , to serve at little public cost . </s>
<s> They can volunteer at any of thousands of non-profit institutions , or participate in service programs required * by high schools or encouraged * by colleges or employers . </s>
<s> Underclass youth do n't have those opportunities . </s>
<s> They are not enrolled in high school or college . </s>
<s> They are unlikely * to be employed *-1 . </s>
<s> And they have grown up in unprecedentedly grim circumstances , among family structures breaking down , *-1 surrounded by self-destructive behaviors and bleak prospects . </s>
<s> But many of them can be quite profoundly reoriented *-1 by productive and disciplined service . </s>
<s> Some wo n't accept the discipline ; others drop out for other reasons . </s>
<s> But some whom nothing else is reaching *T*-2 are transformed *-1 . </s>
<s> * Learning skills , producing something cooperatively , feeling useful , they are no longer dependent -- others now depend on them . </s>
<s> Even if it *EXP*-1 is cheaper * to build playgrounds or paint apartments or plant dune-grass with paid professionals , the effects on the young people providing those services alter the calculation . </s>
<s> * Strictly speaking , these youth are not performing service . </s>
<s> They are giving up no income , deferring no careers , incurring no risk . </s>
<s> But they believe themselves to be serving , and they begin *-1 to respect themselves -LRB- and others -RRB- , to take control of their lives , to think of the future . </s>
<s> That is a service to the nation . </s>
<s> It is what federal support should try hardest *-2 to achieve *T*-1 . </s>

<s> Government officials here and in other countries laid plans *ICH*-1 through the weekend * to head off a Monday market meltdown -- but went out of their way *-2 to keep their moves quiet . </s>
<s> Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was on the telephones , * making it *EXP*-1 clear to officials in the U.S. and abroad that the Fed was prepared * to inject massive amounts of money into the banking system , as it did in October 1987 , if the action were needed * to prevent a financial crisis . </s>
<s> And at the Treasury , Secretary Nicholas Brady talked with friends and associates on Wall Street while Assistant Secretary David Mullins carefully analyzed data on the Friday market plunge . </s>
<s> But the officials feared that any public announcements would only increase market jitters . </s>
<s> In addition , officials at the Fed and in the Bush administration decided that * avoiding overt actions and statements over the weekend would give them more strength and flexibility should Friday 's market drop turn into this morning 's rout . </s>
<s> `` The disadvantage at this point is that anything 0 you do *T*-2 that *T*-1 looks like you are doing too much tends *-4 to reinforce a sense of crisis , '' said *T*-3 one government official , insisting on anonymity . </s>
<s> The Fed 's efforts at secrecy were partly foiled *-1 Sunday morning , when both the New York Times and the Washington Post carried stories quoting a senior Fed official saying 0 the central bank was prepared * to pour cash into the banking system Monday morning *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Fed Chairman Greenspan was surprised *-1 by both stories , according to knowledgeable sources , and insisted 0 he had n't authorized any public comment . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Fed officials acknowledged 0 the stories were reasonably accurate portrayals of the central bank 's game plan . </s>
<s> It is prepared * to assume the same role 0 it played *T*-2 in October 1987 , * providing money to the markets if * necessary * to keep the financial system afloat . </s>
<s> The Fed provides money to the banking system by *-1 buying government securities from financial institutions . </s>
<s> The reticence of federal officials was evident in the appearance Sunday of Budget Director Richard Darman on ABC 's `` This Week . '' </s>
<s> `` Secretary of the Treasury Brady and Chairman Greenspan and the chairman of the SEC and others have been in close contact . </s>

<s> At the Treasury , Secretary Brady issued a statement minimizing the stock market 's drop . </s>
<s> `` Today 's stock market decline does n't signal any fundamental change in the condition of the economy , '' he said *T*-1 . </s>
<s> `` The economy remains well-balanced , and the outlook is for continued moderate growth . '' </s>
<s> But administration officials conceded that Friday 's drop carried the chance of further declines this week . </s>
<s> `` One possibility is that this is a surgical setback , reasonably limited in its breadth , and not a major problem , '' said *T*-2 one senior administration official , who also *T*-3 asked that he not be named *-1 . </s>
<s> `` The other is that we see another major disaster , like two years ago . </s>
<s> I think 0 that 's less likely . '' </s>
<s> Nevertheless , Fed Chairman Greenspan and Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson were in their offices Sunday evening , * monitoring events as they unfolded in markets around the world . </s>
<s> The action was expected *-1 to begin with the opening of the New Zealand foreign exchange markets at 5 p.m. EST -- when stocks there plunged *T*-2 -- and to continue as the trading day began later in the evening in Tokyo and through early this morning in Europe . </s>

<s> He had frequent telephone consultations with Mr. Brady and Michael Boskin , chairman of the counsel of economic advisers . </s>

<s> That 's the advice of most investment professionals after Friday 's 190-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> No one can say for sure what *T*-1 will happen today . </s>
<s> And investment pros are divided on whether stocks will perform well or badly in the next six months . </s>
<s> But they 're nearly unanimous on one point : * Do n't sell into a panic . </s>
<s> Investors who *T*-1 sold everything after the crash of 1987 lived *-2 to regret it . </s>
<s> Even after Friday 's plunge , the Dow Jones Industrial Average was 48 % above where it landed on Oct. 19 two years ago *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Panic selling also was unwise during other big declines in the past . </s>
<s> The crash of 1929 was followed *-1 by a substantial recovery before the great Depression and awful bear market of the 1930s began . </s>
<s> The `` October massacres '' of 1978 and 1979 were scary , but did n't lead to severe or sustained downturns . </s>
<s> Indeed , some pros see Friday 's plunge , plus any further damage that *T*-1 might occur early this week , as a chance for bargain hunting . </s>
<s> `` There has been a lot of emotional selling that *T*-1 presents a nice buying opportunity if you 've got the cash , '' says *T*-2 Stephen B. Timbers , chief investment officer of Chicago-based Kemper Financial Services Inc . </s>
<s> But most advisers think 0 the immediate course for individual investors should be * to stand *-1 pat . </s>
<s> `` When you see a runaway train , '' says *T*-1 Steve Janachowski , partner in the San Francisco investment advisory firm Brouwer & Janachowski , `` you wait for the train to stop . '' </s>
<s> Even for people who *T*-1 expect a bear market in coming months -- and a sizable number of money managers and market pundits do *?* -- the advice is : * Wait for the market to bounce back , and sell shares gradually during rallies . </s>
<s> The best thing 0 individual investors can do *T*-2 is * `` just sit tight , '' says *T*-3 Marshall B. Front , executive vice president and head of investment counseling at Stein Roe & Farnham Inc. , a Chicago-based investment counseling firm that *T*-1 manages about $ 18 billion *U* . </s>
<s> On the one hand , Mr. Front says 0 *T*-2 , it *EXP*-1 would be misguided * to sell into `` a classic panic . '' </s>
<s> On the other hand , it 's not necessarily a good time 0 * to jump in and buy *T*-1 . </s>
<s> `` This is all emotion right now , and when emotion starts *-2 to run *T*-1 , it can run further than anyone anticipates , '' he said *T*-3 . </s>
<s> `` So it *EXP*-1 's more prudent * to wait and see how things stabilize *T*-2 . '' </s>
<s> Roger Ibbotson , professor of finance at Yale University and head of the market information firm Ibbotson Associates Inc. , says , `` My real advice would be * to just ride through it . </s>

<s> `` We 're dedicated long-term investors , not traders , '' he says *T*-1 . </s>
<s> `` We understand panics and euphoria . </s>
<s> And we hope *-1 to take advantage of panics and buy stocks when they plunge *T*-2 . '' </s>
<s> One camp of investment pros sees what *T*-1 happened Friday as an opportunity . </s>
<s> Over the next days and weeks , they say 0 *T*-1 , investors should look for stocks 0 * to buy *T*-2 . </s>

<s> And Mr. Craig expects *-1 to pick up more shares today . </s>
<s> `` It will be chaotic at first , but I would not be buying if I thought 0 we were headed *-1 for real trouble , '' he says *T*-2 . </s>

<s> On Thursday , William Fleckenstein , a Seattle money manager , used futures contracts in his personal account *-1 to place a bet that the broad market averages would decline . </s>

<s> In the pension accounts 0 he manages *T*-1 , Mr. Fleckenstein has raised cash positions and invested in gold *RNR*-2 and natural gas *RNR*-2 stocks , partly as an inflation hedge . </s>
<s> He thinks 0 government officials are terrified * to let a recession start when government , corporate and personal debt levels are so high *T*-1 . </s>
<s> So he thinks 0 the government will err on the side of rekindled inflation . </s>

<s> David M. Jones , vice president at Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. , recommends Treasury securities -LRB- of up to five years ' maturity -RRB- . </s>
<s> He says 0 the Oct. 6 employment report , showing slower economic growth and a severe weakening in the manufacturing sector , is a warning sign to investors . </s>
<s> One strategy for investors who *T*-1 want *-3 to stay in but hedge their bets is * to buy `` put '' options , either on the individual stocks 0 they own *T*-2 or on a broad market index . </s>
<s> A put option gives its holder the right -LRB- but not the obligation -RRB- * to sell a stock -LRB- or stock index -RRB- for a specified price -LRB- the strike price -RRB- until the option expires . </s>
<s> Whether this insurance is worthwhile depends on the cost of an option . </s>
<s> The cost , or premium , tends * to get fat in times of crisis . </s>
<s> Thus , * buying puts after a big market slide can be an expensive way 0 * to hedge against risk *T*-1 . </s>
<s> The prices of puts generally did n't soar Friday . </s>
<s> For example , the premium as a percentage of the stock price for certain puts on Eli Lilly & Co. moved up from 3 % at Thursday 's close to only 3.3 % at Friday 's close , even though the shares dropped more than $ 5.50 *U* . </s>
<s> But put-option prices may zoom when trading resumes today *T*-1 . </s>
<s> It *EXP*-2 's hard * to generalize about a reasonable price for puts . </s>
<s> But investors should keep in mind , before * paying too much , that the average annual return for stock holdings , long-term , is 9 % to 10 % *U* a year ; a return of 15 % is considered *-1 praiseworthy . </s>

<s> A further slide also would resurrect debate over a host of other , more sweeping changes proposed -- but not implemented -- after the last crash . </s>
<s> Most notably , several of the regulatory steps recommended * by the Brady Task Force , which *T*-2 analyzed the 1987 crash , would be revived *-1 -- especially because that group 's chairman is now the Treasury secretary . </s>
<s> The most controversial of the Brady recommendations involved * establishing a single overarching regulator * to handle crucial cross-market questions , such as * setting consistent margin requirements for the stock and futures markets . </s>
<s> But for the moment , attention focuses on the reforms that *T*-2 were put *-1 into place , and market regulators and participants said 0 the circuit breakers worked as * intended . </s>
<s> Big Board and Merc officials expressed satisfaction with the results of two limits imposed * on of the Merc 's Standard & Poor 's 500 contract , as well as `` hot-line '' communications among exchanges . </s>
<s> Those pauses -- from 2:07 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. CDT and from 2:45 p.m. until the close of trading a half-hour later -- forced traders to buy and sell contracts at prices at *RNR*-1 or higher than *RNR*-1 their frozen levels . </s>
<s> During the first halt , after the S&P index had fallen 12 points , the Big Board 's `` Sidecar '' computer program automatically was triggered *-1 . </s>
<s> That system is designed *-1 * to separate computer-generated program trades from all other trades * to help exchange officials resolve order imbalances in individual stocks . </s>
<s> One Merc broker compared the action in the S&P pit during the two freezes to a fire at a well-drilled school . </s>
<s> `` You do n't want the fire but you know what * to do *T*-1 , '' said *T*-2 Howard Dubnow , an independent floor broker and a Merc governor . </s>
<s> `` There was no panic . </s>
<s> The system worked the way 0 we devised it to work *T*-1 . '' </s>
<s> After * reopening for about 15 minutes , the S&P index tumbled to its 30-point limit and the second freeze went into effect . </s>
<s> Traders then spent the last half-hour * `` watching * to see if the Dow would drop 250 points , '' Mr. Dubnow added 0 *T*-2 , * referring to the level at which the stock market itself would have closed for an hour *T*-1 . </s>
<s> One observer estimated that 80 % to 90 % *U* of the S&P traders `` were just standing around *-1 watching . '' </s>
<s> But the 250-point circuit breaker never had *-2 to kick in , and freezes on the Chicago Board of Trade 's Major Market Index also were n't triggered *-1 . </s>
<s> The MMI and the S&P 500 are the two major indexes used * by program traders *-1 to run their computerized trading strategies . </s>
<s> The programs are considered by many *-1 to be a major cause of the 1987 crash . </s>
<s> The process of post-crash reforms began with calls 0 *T*-1 to remake the markets and wound up a year later with a series of rather technical adjustments . </s>
<s> In October 1987 , just after the market drop , Washington was awash in talk of sweeping changes in the way 0 the financial markets are structured and regulated *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Over the next year that grand agenda was whittled *-1 down to a series of steps 0 * to soften big stock drops by * interrupting trading * to give market players time 0 * to pause and reconsider positions *T*-3 *T*-2 . </s>
<s> In addition , limits were placed *-1 on computer-driven trading , and steps were taken *-2 * to better link the stock and futures markets . </s>
<s> Few changes were made *-1 in the way 0 the markets are regulated *-2 *T*-3 . </s>
<s> At the outset the prime target was program trading , which *T*-1 was much discussed but little understood on Capitol Hill . </s>
<s> There were also calls 0 * to strip the stock markets of `` derivative '' products , such as stock-index futures and options , which Federal Judge Stanley Sporkin , for example , likened *T*-1 to `` barnacles attached to the basic market *T*-2 . '' </s>
<s> And there was much criticism of the New York Stock Exchange 's system of * having stock trades flow through specialists , or market makers . </s>
<s> When the Brady Task Force 's powerful analysis of the crash was released *-1 in January 1988 *T*-2 , it immediately reshaped the reformers ' agenda . </s>
<s> * Arguing that the separate financial marketplaces acted as one , and concluding that the crash had `` raised the possibility of a full-scale financial system breakdown , '' the presidential task force called for * establishing a super-regulator *-1 to oversee the markets , *-1 to make margins consistent across markets , *-1 to unify clearing systems and *-1 to install circuit breakers . </s>
<s> Only the last of those recommendations ever was implemented *-1 . </s>
<s> The Reagan White House held the Brady recommendations at arm 's length and named a second panel -- the Working Group on the Financial Markets -- to review its analysis and those of other crash studies . </s>
<s> In May 1988 , the Working Group , made up of representatives from the Federal Reserve , the Treasury , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission , finally endorsed only circuit breakers . </s>
<s> After several more months of arguments among various stock exchanges and futures markets , circuit breakers were set *-1 in place , with the most notable suspending trading after 250 and 400 point drops in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> Privately , some free marketeers dismissed such mechanisms as sops to interventionists . </s>
<s> After all , this free-market argument went 0 *T*-1 , the Dow only dropped more than 250 points once this century . </s>
<s> `` Circuit breakers '' set * * to soften big drops : </s>
<s> -- If S&P futures fall 5 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes . </s>
<s> -- If Dow Industrials fall 25 points at opening , contract trading pauses for 10 minutes . </s>
<s> -- If S&P futures fall 12 points -LRB- equivalent to about 100 points on DJIA -RRB- , trading is frozen *-1 for half hour to that price or higher . </s>
<s> On NYSE program trades are diverted *-1 into a separate computer file * to determine buy and sell orders . </s>
<s> -- If S&P futures fall 30 points , trading is restricted *-1 for an hour to that price or higher . </s>
<s> -- If Dow Industrials fall 250 points , trading on the Big Board halts for an hour . </s>

<s> It all seemed innocent enough : Last April , one Steven B. Iken visited Justin Products Inc. here , identified himself as a potential customer and got the word on the little company 's new cassette players for children . </s>

<s> The Justin merchandise carried wholesale prices some 40 % below those of Sony Corp. of Japan 's `` My First Sony '' line . </s>
<s> The visitor waxed * enthusiastic and promised *-1 to return . </s>
<s> But instead of a new customer -- part of a hoped-for bonanza from * underselling Sony -- Justin got a costly legal morass *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Mr. Iken , it turned out *T*-1 , was a private detective using a hidden tape recorder *-2 to gather information for Sony . </s>

<s> *-2 Seeking *-1 to keep Justin 's `` My Own '' product line off the U.S. market , Sony last May filed a suit *ICH*-3 in Manhattan federal court accusing the upstart of trademark infringement , unfair competition and other violations of business law . </s>

<s> Justin 's plight shows what *T*-1 can happen when a tiny company suddenly faces the full legal might of a wrathful multinational . </s>
<s> With considerable irony , the case also shows how completely Japan has turned the tables on U.S. business *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Americans used *-1 to complain bitterly about *-1 being undersold by look-alike products from Japan . </s>
<s> Now Sony , whose innovative , premium-priced products *T*-1 are among the most admired in consumer electronics , is bitterly complaining about a little U.S. firm with a cheap look-alike produced * in China . </s>
<s> `` The gist of this is that Justin knocked off the Sony line and Sony wants *-3 to stop it , '' says *T*-2 Lewis H. Eslinger , Sony 's attorney , who *T*-1 previously guarded Rubik 's Cube . </s>
<s> -LRB- Sony itself declines *-1 to comment . -RRB- </s>
<s> If Sony wins , Mr. Eslinger says , its little rival will have *-1 to try *-2 to sell the products overseas . </s>
<s> At worst , he adds *T*-1 , `` They 'd have *-2 to grind them all up and throw them away . '' </s>
<s> Mr. Kaye denies the suit 's charges and says 0 his only mistake was * taking on Sony in the marketplace . </s>
<s> `` I made a similar line and I produced it cheaper , '' he says *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Today , U.S. Judge John E. Sprizzo is expected *-1 to rule on Sony 's renewed request for a pre-trial order blocking sale of the disputed products , on which deliveries began in July *T*-2 . </s>
<s> The judge turned down an earlier Sony request for such an order -- a decision upheld * on appeal -- but Sony returned with additional evidence and arguments . </s>
<s> Though *-1 hoping *-2 to settle the case , Justin vows *-1 to fight on , if necessary . </s>
<s> But the battle is more than Justin bargained for *?* . </s>
<s> `` I had no idea 0 I was getting in so deep , '' says *T*-2 Mr. Kaye , who *T*-1 founded Justin in 1982 . </s>
<s> Mr. Kaye had sold Capetronic Inc. , a Taiwan electronics maker , and retired , only * to find 0 he was bored . </s>
<s> With Justin , he began *-1 selling toys and electronics made * mostly in Hong Kong , * beginning with Mickey Mouse radios . </s>
<s> The company has grown -- to about 40 employees , from four initially , Mr. Kaye says *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Justin has been profitable since 1986 , adds 0 *T*-2 the official , who *T*-1 shares his office with numerous teddy bears , all samples from his line of plush toys . </s>
<s> Like many others , Mr. Kaye took notice in 1987 when Sony , in a classic example of market segmentation , changed the plastic skin and buttons on the famous Walkman line of portable audio equipment and created the My First Sony line for children . </s>
<s> The brightly colored new products looked more like toys than the adult models . </s>
<s> -LRB- In court papers , Sony says 0 it has spent more than $ 3 million *U* *-1 to promote the line , with resulting sales of over a million units . -RRB- </s>
<s> Sony found a new market niche , but Mr. Kaye figured that its prices left plenty of room for a lower-priced competitor . </s>
<s> His products are n't exact copies of Sony 's but strongly resemble them in size , shape and , especially , color . </s>
<s> Sony uses mostly red and blue , with traces of yellow -- and so does Justin , on the theory that kids prefer these colors . </s>
<s> -LRB- `` * To be successful , a product can be any color whatsoever , as long as it is fire-engine red , '' says *T*-1 Charles E. Baxley , Justin 's attorney . -RRB- </s>
<s> By last winter , Justin was showing prototypes at toy fairs in Hong Kong and New York -- and Sony noticed . </s>
<s> Indeed , *-1 concerned that Sony sales personnel were threatening legal action or other retaliation -- such as * withholding desirable Sony products -- against Justin 's customers , Mr. Baxley fired off a letter to Sony in April . </s>
<s> He himself threatened *-1 to take the matter to the Federal Trade Commission or U.S. Justice Department . </s>
<s> But Justin has n't pursued those charges -LRB- which *T*-1 were without merit , according to Mr. Eslinger , the Sony attorney -RRB- . </s>
<s> Recalls Mr. Baxley : `` Our purpose was * to influence them to leave us alone . </s>
<s> We never intended *-1 taking on Sony -- we do n't have the resources . '' </s>
<s> Sony answered the empty threat with its real suit . </s>
<s> Off and on since then , the companies have skirmished in court . </s>
<s> And Justin , in a news release , says , `` *-1 Once competitive , Sony now resorts to strong-arm tactics in American courtrooms *-1 to carve out *RNR*-2 and protect *RNR*-2 niche markets . '' </s>
<s> Sony 's lawyer insists that the company 's tactics -- including the use of a private detective posing as a buyer -- are routine in such matters . </s>
<s> He also insists that Sony , no less than others , has a legal right * to protect its `` trade dress , '' in this case , mostly the colors that it claims 0 *T*-1 make My First Sony products distinctive . </s>
<s> -LRB- Justin claims 0 it began *-1 using the same colors on electronic goods for children long before Sony entered the children 's market . -RRB- </s>
<s> Whatever its merits , Sony 's aggressive defense is debilitating for Justin . </s>
<s> It 's also costly . </s>
<s> Mr. Kaye says 0 he has paid more than $ 70,000 *U* in legal fees so far . </s>
<s> Of Sony , Mr. Kaye says : `` They know 0 there 's no way 0 for them to lose *T*-1 . </s>

<s> Indeed , a Moody 's index that *T*-1 tracks the net asset values of 24 high-yield mutual funds declined for the 17th consecutive day Friday . </s>
<s> In a stark contrast , the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond climbed more than 2 1\/2 points , or about $ 25 *U* for each $ 1,000 *U* face amount , to 103 12\/32 , its biggest gain of the year . </s>
<s> The bond 's yield dropped to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group . </s>
<s> The yield on three-month Treasury bills , considered the safest of all investments , plummeted about 0.7 percentage point to 7.16 % , the largest one-day decline since 1982 . </s>
<s> The main catalyst for government bond market rally was the 190.58-point drop in the Dow Jones Industrial Average . </s>
<s> `` When you get panic in one market *T*-1 , you get flight to quality in the other , '' said *T*-2 Maria Ramirez , money market economist at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the problems of the junk market could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease credit in the months ahead . </s>
<s> `` This marks a significant shift in the interest rate outlook , '' says *T*-1 William Sullivan , director of money market research at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. , New York . </s>
<s> Any sustained credit-easing could be a lift for junk bonds as well as other securities . </s>
<s> Robert Dow , a partner and portfolio manager at Lord , Abbett & Co. , which *T*-1 manages $ 4 billion *U* of high-yield bonds , says 0 he does n't `` think 0 there is any fundamental economic rationale -LCB- for the junk bond rout -RCB- . </s>

<s> I do n't believe 0 that 's the case , but I believe that people are running *-1 scared . </s>
<s> There is a flight to quality , and the quality is not in equities and not in junk -- it 's in Treasurys . '' </s>
<s> Even as trading in high-yield issues dried up over the past month , corporations sold more than $ 2 billion *U* of new junk bonds . </s>
<s> For example , a recent $ 375 million *U* offering of Petrolane Gas Services L.P. bonds sold * by First Boston was three times oversubscribed . </s>
<s> A $ 550 million *U* offering of Turner Broadcasting System Inc . high-yield securities sold last week by Drexel was increased *-1 $ 50 million *U* because of strong demand . </s>
<s> First Boston estimates that in November and December alone , junk bond investors will receive $ 4.8 billion *U* of coupon interest payments . </s>
<s> `` That 's a clear indication that there is *RNR*-1 and will be *RNR*-1 an undercurrent of basic business going on , '' says *T*-2 Mr. Carleton of First Boston . </s>
<s> `` I do n't know how people can say 0 the junk bond market disappeared *T*-3 when there were $ 1.5 billion *U* of orders for $ 550 million *U* of junk bonds sold last week by Turner *T*-2 , '' says *T*-1 Raymond Minella , co-head of merchant banking at Merrill Lynch & Co . </s>

<s> But such highly leveraged transactions seemed *-1 to have multiplied this year , * casting a pall over much of the junk market . </s>
<s> Michael McNamara , director of fixed-income research at Kemper Financial Services , says 0 the quality of junk issues has been getting poorer , * contributing to the slide in prices . </s>
<s> `` Last year we probably bought one out of every three new deals , '' he says *T*-1 . </s>
<s> `` This year , at best , it 's in one in every five or six . </s>
<s> And our credit standards have n't changed one iota . '' </s>
<s> However , Mr. McNamara said 0 the slide in junk is creating `` one hell of a buying opportunity '' for selective buyers . </s>
<s> For the moment , investors seem more preoccupied with the `` bad '' junk than the `` good '' junk . </s>
<s> `` The market has been weak since '' the announcement of the Campeau cash squeeze and the company 's subsequent bailout by Olympia & York , says *T*-1 Mr. Minella of Merrill Lynch . </s>
<s> `` That really affected the market in that people started *-2 to ask ` What else *T*-1 is in trouble ? ' '' </s>
<s> Well before Campeau , though , there were signs that the junk market was stumbling through one of its worst years ever . </s>
<s> Despite the relatively strong economy , junk bond prices did nothing except go down , * hammered by a seemingly endless trail of bad news : </s>
<s> -- In June , two months before it would default on interest payments covering some of its $ 1.2 billion *U* of speculative debt securities , New York-based Integrated Resources Inc. said 0 it ran out of borrowed money . </s>
<s> -- In July , Southmark Corp. , the Dallas-based real estate and financial services company with about $ 1.3 billion *U* of junk bonds , voluntarily filed for protection under U.S. bankruptcy law . </s>
<s> -- By the end of July , the difference in yield between an index of junk bonds and seven-year Treasury notes widened to more than 5.5 percentage points . </s>
<s> -- In August , Resorts International Inc. , which *T*-1 sold more than $ 500 million *U* of junk bonds , suspended interest payments . </s>
<s> -- In September , just as the cash squeeze hit Campeau , Lomas Financial Corp. defaulted on $ 145 million *U* of notes and appeared unlikely *-1 to pay interest on a total of $ 1.2 billion *U* of debt securities . </s>
<s> Meantime , regulators are becoming increasingly worried as the rush to leverage shows no signs of *-1 abating . </s>
<s> Moody 's says 0 the frequency of corporate credit downgrades is the highest this year since 1982 . </s>
<s> In addition , there are six times as many troubled banks as there were in the recession of 1981 , according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . </s>
<s> `` The era of the 1980s is about compound interest and the reaching for it , '' says *T*-1 James Grant , editor of Grant 's Interest Rate Observer , an early critic of the junk bond market . </s>
<s> `` What we 've begun *-1 to see *T*-2 is the damage to businesses of * paying exorbitant compound interest . </s>

<s> Friday 's Market Activity </s>
<s> Prices of Treasury bonds surged in the biggest rally of the year as investors fled a plummeting stock market . </s>
<s> The benchmark 30-year Treasury bond was quoted *-1 6 p.m. EDT at 103 12\/32 , compared * with 100 27\/32 Thursday , up 2 1\/2 points . </s>
<s> The yield on the benchmark fell to 7.82 % , the lowest since March 31 , 1987 , according to Technical Data Global Markets Group . </s>
<s> The `` flight to quality '' began late in the day and followed a precipitous fall in the stock market . </s>
<s> Treasurys opened lower , * reacting negatively to news that the producer price index -- a measure of inflation on the wholesale level -- accelerated in September . </s>
<s> Bond prices barely budged until midday . </s>
<s> Many bond market participants will be closely eying the action of the Federal Reserve , which *T*-1 might repeat its October 1987 injection of huge amounts of liquidity * to buoy the financial markets and keep the economy from *-2 slowing into a recession . </s>
<s> Prices of municipals , investment-grade corporates and mortgage-backed bonds also rose , but lagged behind their Treasury counterparts . </s>
<s> Mortgage securities rose in hectic trading , with most of the activity concentrated in Government National Mortgage Association 9 % coupon securities , the most liquid mortgage issue . </s>
<s> The Ginnie Mae November 9 % issue ended at 98 25\/32 , up 7\/8 point on the day , * to yield about 9.28 % to a 12-year average life assumption . </s>
<s> Investment-grade corporate bonds were up about 1\/2 to 3\/4 point . </s>
<s> But the yield spread between lower-quality , investment-grade issues and higher-quality bonds widened . </s>
<s> And the yields on telephone and utility issues rose relative to other investment-grade bonds in anticipation of this week 's $ 3 billion *U* bond offering by the Tennessee Valley Authority . </s>
<s> Despite rumors that the TVA 's long-awaited offering would be postponed *-1 because of the debacle in the equity markets , sources in the underwriting syndicate said 0 they expect 0 the issue will be priced *-2 as * scheduled . </s>
<s> One of the sources said 0 the smaller portions of $ 750 million *U* each of five-year and 10-year bonds have already been `` substantially oversubscribed *-1 . '' </s>
<s> Municipal bonds rose as much as 3\/4 point . </s>
<s> Roger Lowenstein contributed to this article . </s>
<s> Friday 's 190-point plunge in stocks does not come atop the climate of anxiety that *T*-3 dominated financial markets just prior to their 1987 October crash , and mechanisms have been put *-2 in place * to keep markets more orderly . </s>
<s> Still , the lesson is about the same : On Friday the 13th , the market was spooked *-1 by Washington . </s>
<s> The consensus along the street seems *-2 to be that the plunge was triggered *-1 by the financing problems of the UAL takeover , and it 's certainly true 0 the rout began immediately after the UAL trading halt . </s>
<s> Still , the consensus *ICH*-2 seems almost as wide that one faltering bid is no reason 0 * to write down the value of all U.S. business *T*-1 . </s>
<s> This observation leads us to another piece of news moving on the Dow Jones ticker shortly before the downturn : the success of Senate Democrats in * stalling the capital gains tax cut . </s>
<s> The real value of all shares , after all , is directly impacted *-1 by the tax on any profits -LRB- all the more so given the limits on deductions for losses that *T*-2 show 0 gains are not `` ordinary income '' -RRB- . </s>
<s> And market expectations clearly have been raised *-1 by the capital gains victory in the House last month . </s>
<s> An hour before Friday 's plunge , that provision was stripped *-1 from the tax bill , * leaving it with $ 5.4 billion *U* in tax increases without a capital gains cut . </s>
<s> There is a great deal 0 *T*-2 to be said *-1 , * to be sure , for * stripping the garbage out of the reconciliation bill . </s>
<s> It would be a good thing if Congress started *-1 to decide issues one-by-one on their individual merits without trickery . </s>
<s> For one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an up-or-down vote . </s>
<s> Since Senate leaders have so far fogged it up with procedural smokescreens , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect . </s>
<s> Especially so since President Bush has been weakened *-1 by the Panama fiasco . </s>
<s> To the extent that the UAL troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of Washington 's sticky fingers . </s>
<s> As the best opportunities for corporate restructurings are exhausted *-1 of course , at some point the market will start *-2 to reject them . </s>
<s> But the airlines are scarcely a clear case , * given anti-takeover mischief by Secretary of Transportation Skinner , who *T*-2 professes *-4 to believe 0 safety will be compromised *-1 if KLM and British Airways own interests in companies that *T*-3 fly airplanes . </s>
<s> Worse , Congress has started *-1 to jump on the Skinner bandwagon . </s>
<s> James Oberstar , the Minnesota Democrat who *T*-2 chairs the Public Works and Transportation Committee 's aviation subcommittee , has put an anti-airline takeover bill on supersonic speed so that it would be passed *-1 in time * to affect the American and United Air Lines bids . </s>
<s> It would give Mr. Skinner up to 50 days * to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any U.S. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion *U* or more . </s>
<s> So the UAL deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points . </s>
<s> Congratulations , Mr. Secretary and Mr. Congressman . </s>
<s> In the 1987 crash , * remember , the market was shaken *-1 by a Danny Rostenkowski proposal * to tax takeovers out of existance . </s>
<s> Even more important , in our view , was *T*-1 the Treasury 's threat * to thrash the dollar . </s>
<s> The Treasury is doing the same thing today ; thankfully , the dollar is not under 1987-style pressure . </s>
<s> Also , traders are in better shape *ICH*-1 *ICH*-2 today than in 1987 * to survive selling binges . </s>
<s> They are better capitalized *-1 . </s>
<s> They are in less danger of *-1 losing liquidity simply because of tape lags and clearing and settlement delays . </s>
<s> The Fed promises any needed liquidity . </s>
<s> The Big Board 's liaison with the Chicago Board of Trade has improved ; it *EXP*-1 will be interesting * to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove *-2 to be a good idea . </s>
<s> In any event , some traders see stocks as underpriced today , unlike 1987 . </s>
<s> There is nothing wrong with the market that *T*-2 ca n't be cured *-1 by a little coherence and common sense in Washington . </s>
<s> But on the bearish side , that may be too much 0 * to expect *T*-1 . </s>
<s> First Chicago Corp. posted a third-quarter loss of $ 23.3 million *U* after *-1 joining other big banks in *-2 further adding to its reserves for losses on foreign loans . </s>
<s> The parent company of First National Bank of Chicago , with $ 48 billion *U* in assets , said 0 it set aside $ 200 million *U* * to absorb losses on loans and investments in financially troubled countries . </s>
<s> The addition , on top of two big 1987 additions to foreign-loan reserves , brings the reserve to a level equaling 79 % of medium-term and long-term loans outstanding to troubled nations . </s>
<s> First Chicago since 1987 has reduced its loans to such nations to $ 1.7 billion *U* from $ 3 billion *U* . </s>
<s> Despite this loss , First Chicago said 0 it does n't need *-1 to sell stock *-1 to raise capital . </s>
<s> During the quarter , the company realized a pretax gain of $ 60.4 million *U* from the sale of its First Chicago Investment Advisors unit . </s>
<s> Combined foreign exchange and bond trading profits dipped 24 % against last year 's third quarter , to $ 38.2 million *U* from $ 50.5 million *U* . </s>
<s> Gains from First Chicago 's venture capital unit , a big leveraged buy-out investor , rose 32 % to $ 34 million *U* from $ 25.7 million *U* a year ago . </s>

<s> Greece 's second bout of general elections this year is slated *-1 for Nov. 5 . </s>
<s> For those hoping * to see a modicum of political normalcy restored -- in view of Greece 's eight-year misadventure under autocratic pseudosocialism and subsequent three-month hitch with a conservative-communist coalition government -- there is but one bright sign : The scandals still encircling former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou and his fallen socialist government are like flies buzzing around a rotting carcass . </s>
<s> In the mid-June round of voting , Greeks gave no clear mandate to any single political party . </s>
<s> The ad interim coalition government that *T*-1 emerged from post-electoral hagglings was , in essence , little more than the ill-conceived offspring of ideological miscegenation : On one side , the center-right New Democracy Party , headed * by Constantine Mitsotakis . </s>
<s> On the other , the so-called Coalition of the Left and Progress -- a quaint and rather deceptive title for a merger of the pro-Soviet Communist Party of Greece and its Euro-Communist cousin , the Hellenic Left . </s>
<s> The unifying bond for this left-right mismatch was plain : PASOK -LRB- Mr. Papandreou 's party -RRB- as common political enemy . </s>
<s> The ostensible goal was a mop-up of government corruption , purportedly at all levels , but the main marks were Mr. Papandreou and his closest associates . </s>
<s> In point of fact , this catharsis was overdue by decades . </s>
<s> When * reduced to buzzword status in ex parte pledges *T*-1 , however , the notion transmogrified into a promised assault , with targets primarily for political gains , not justice . </s>
<s> With regard to Greece 's long-bubbling bank-looting scandal , Mr. Papandreou 's principal accuser remains George Koskotas , former owner of the Bank of Crete and self-confessed embezzler , now residing in a jail cell in Salem , Mass. , from where he is fighting extradition proceedings that *T*-1 would return him to Greece *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Mr. Koskotas 's credibility is , at best , problematic . </s>
<s> He has ample motive * to shift the blame , and his testimony has also been found *-1 less than forthright on numerous points . </s>
<s> Nevertheless , the New Democracy and Communist parties herald his assertions as proof of PASOK complicity . </s>
<s> Among unanswered questions are *T*-3 whether Mr. Papandreou received $ 23 million *U* of stolen Bank of Crete funds and an additional $ 734,000 *U* in bribes , as * contended *-4 ; whether the prime minister ordered state agencies *-5 to deposit some $ 57 million *U* in Mr. Koskotas 's bank and then skim off the interest ; and , what PASOK 's cut was *T*-1 from the $ 210 million *U* 0 Mr. Koskotas pinched *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Two former ministers were so heavily implicated in the Koskotas affair that PASOK members of Parliament voted *-1 to refer them to the special court . </s>
<s> But eluding parliamentary probe was *T*-2 the case of millions of drachmas 0 Mr. Koskotas funneled *T*-1 into New Democracy coffers . </s>
<s> In the end , the investigation produced only circumstantial evidence and `` indications '' that *T*-1 point to PASOK , not clinching proof . </s>
<s> On another issue , Greeks were told *-1 how their national intelligence agency , the EYP , regularly monitored the telephone conversations of prominent figures , including key opposition politicians , journalists and PASOK cabinet members . </s>
<s> Despite convincing arguments , it was never established *-1 that Mr. Papandreou personally ordered or directed the wiretaps . </s>
<s> The central weakness of the `` scandals '' debates was pointed up especially well when discussions focused on arms deals and kickbacks *T*-1 . </s>
<s> The coalition government tried *-1 to show that PASOK ministers had received hefty sums for * OKing the purchase of F-16 Fighting Falcon and Mirage 2000 combat aircraft , produced * by the U.S.based General Dynamics Corp. and France 's Avions Marcel Dassault , respectively . </s>
<s> Naturally , neither General Dynamics nor Dassault could be expected *-1 to hamper its prospective future dealings by *-2 making disclosures of sums paid * -LRB- or not -RRB- to various Greek officials for services rendered * . </s>
<s> So it seems that Mr. Mitsotakis and his communist chums may have unwittingly served Mr. Papandreou a moral victory on a platter : PASOK , whether guilty or not , can now traipse the countryside * condemning the whole affair as a witch hunt at Mr. Papandreou 's expense . </s>
<s> But while verbal high jinks alone wo n't help PASOK regain power , Mr. Papandreou should never be underestimated *-1 . </s>
<s> First came *T*-1 his predictable fusillade : He charged 0 the Coalition of the Left and Progress had sold out its leftist tenets by * collaborating in a right-wing plot aimed * at * ousting PASOK and thwarting the course of socialism in Greece . </s>
<s> Then , *-1 to buttress his credibility with the left , he enticed some smaller leftist parties to stand for election under the PASOK banner . </s>
<s> Next , he continued *-2 to court the communists -- many of whom *T*-1 feel betrayed by the left-right coalition 's birth -- by * bringing into PASOK a well-respected Communist Party candidate . </s>
<s> For balance , and in hopes of *-1 gaining some disaffected centrist votes , he managed *-1 to attract a former New Democracy Party representative and known political enemy of Mr. Mitsotakis . </s>
<s> Thus PASOK heads for the polls not only with diminished scandal-stench , but also with `` seals of approval '' from representatives of its harshest accusers . </s>
<s> Crucial as these elections are for Greece , pressing issues of state are getting lost in the shuffle . </s>
<s> The country 's future NATO participation remains unsure , for instance . </s>
<s> Greece also must revamp major pieces of legislation in preparation for the 1992 targets of heightened Common Market cooperation . </s>
<s> Greece 's bilateral relations with the U.S. need attention soon as well . </s>
<s> For one , the current accord concerning U.S. military bases in Greece lapses in May 1990 . </s>
<s> Negotiations for a new agreement were frozen *-1 before the June elections , but the clock is running . </s>
<s> Another matter of concern is the extradition of Mohammed Rashid , a Palestinian terrorist who *T*-2 is wanted *-1 in the U.S. for the 1982 bombing of a Pan American Airways flight . </s>
<s> The Greek courts have decided in favor of extradition in the Rashid case , but the matter awaits final approval from Greece 's next justice minister . </s>
<s> The Greeks seem barely aware of the importance of the case as a litmus test of whether Greece will be counted *-1 in or out for international efforts * to combat terrorism . </s>
<s> That PASOK could win the elections outright is improbable ; the Greek press , previously eager * to palm off PASOK 's line , has turned on Mr. Papandreou with a wild-eyed vengeance . </s>
<s> Yet the possibility of another lash-up government is all too real . </s>
<s> If Mr. Papandreou becomes the major opposition leader , he could hamstring a conservative-led coalition . </s>
<s> Also , he could force new elections early next year by * frustrating the procedures for the election of the president of the republic in March . </s>
<s> New Democracy has once again glaringly underestimated the opponent and linked its own prospects to negative reaction against PASOK , * forgetting *-1 to tend to either program clarity or the rectification of internal squabbles . </s>
<s> As for Mr. Papandreou ? </s>
<s> He 's not exactly sitting pretty at this stage . </s>
<s> But since he is undoubtedly one of the most proficient bull slingers who *T*-1 ever raked muck , it *EXP*-2 seems far wiser * to view him as sidelined , but certainly not yet eliminated . </s>

<s> A federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled that shareholders ca n't hold corporate officials liable for false sales projections on new products if the news media concurrently revealed substantial information about the product 's flaws . </s>

<s> Lawyers specializing in shareholder suits said 0 they are concerned that use of the `` press defense '' by corporations may become popular as a result of the ruling . </s>
<s> According to the suit , Apple officials created public excitement by *-2 touting Lisa as an office computer that *T*-1 would revolutionize the workplace and be extremely successful in its first year . </s>
<s> The plaintiffs also alleged that prior to the fanfare , the company circulated internal memos indicating problems with Lisa . </s>
<s> The suit claimed 0 Apple 's stock climbed to a high of $ 63.50 *U* a share on the basis of the company 's optimistic forecasts . </s>
<s> But when the company revealed Lisa 's poor sales late in 1983 *T*-1 , the stock plummeted to a low of $ 17.37 *U* a share , according to the suit . </s>
<s> The shareholders claimed more than $ 150 million *U* in losses . </s>
<s> In 1987 , the San Francisco district court dismissed the case largely because newspaper reports had sufficiently counterbalanced the company 's statements by * alerting consumers to Lisa 's problems . </s>
<s> Late last month , the appeals court agreed that most of the case should be dismissed *-1 . </s>
<s> However , it gave the shareholders the right * to pursue a small portion of their claim that *T*-1 pertains to Lisa 's disk drive , known * as Twiggy . </s>

<s> `` The court was careful * to say that the adverse information appeared in the very same articles *RNR*-1 and received the same attention *RNR*-1 as the company 's statements , '' said *T*-4 Patrick Grannon , a Los Angeles lawyer at the firm of Greenfield & Chimicles , which *T*-3 was n't involved *-2 in the case . </s>

<s> The market -- and investment bankers -- are even less sanguine about companies that *T*-1 have had at least one bid , merger agreement or restructuring plan fall through already . </s>

<s> Hilton Hotels , for example , was among the worst-hit issues , * falling 20.2 % * to close at 85 , down 21 1\/2 on Friday . </s>
<s> Hilton currently is soliciting bids for a sale of part or all of its hotel and casino businesses . </s>
<s> People familiar with Hilton said over the weekend that the depth of the sell-off in Hilton shares was unwarranted because none of the likely buyers would be dependent on junk-bond financing . </s>
<s> However , they conceded that some potential bidders would rely on bank loans and would *-1 be hurt if the troubles of the UAL buy-out group signified a general unwillingness *ICH*-2 among banks * to provide credit for debt-financed takeovers . </s>
<s> Hilton officials said 0 they were n't worried about the drop in the company 's stock . </s>
<s> William Lebo , Hilton 's general counsel , said 0 plans * to consider a sale of the company or some of its assets are `` on track '' for what *T*-2 has been described *-1 previously as `` a slow and deliberate process . '' </s>
<s> `` I ca n't believe that any potential buyer for Hilton would be affected *-1 by one day 's trading , '' Mr. Lebo said *T*-2 . </s>
<s> But the stock market as a whole , *-1 bolstered as it is *?* by takeover speculation , remains vulnerable to any further pullback by takeover financiers , both in the junkbond market and among commercial banks . </s>

<s> Today , metropolitan Houston 's real-estate market is poised for a significant turnaround . </s>

<s> Its population has continued *-1 to increase since 1983 , the peak year of the economic cycle . </s>

<s> Housing building permits are down more than 75 % from their 1983 peaks . </s>
<s> Although no one can predict when metropolitan Denver 's real-estate market will rebound *T*-1 , major public works projects costing several billion dollars *ICH*-2 are under way or planned *-3 -- such as a new convention center , a major beltway encircling the metropolitan area , and a new regional airport . </s>
<s> When Denver 's regional economy begins *-1 to grow faster *T*-2 -- such a recovery could occur as early as next year -- business and consumer confidence will return , and the resulting explosion of real-estate activity will dwarf the general economic rebound . </s>

<s> Vacancy rates in the 15 % to 19 % *U* range today may easily rise to the low to mid-20 % range in a couple of years . </s>
<s> Under these conditions , even a flattening out of economic growth -- `` * catching cold '' -- in the healthy metropolitan areas will create significant opportunities for corporations and professional service firms looking for bargains as the realestate industry catches pneumonia . </s>

<s> For the next two years , the Bank Board , which at the time *T*-1 was the agency responsible for * regulating thrifts , failed *-2 to act -- even after federal auditors warned in May 1987 that Mr. Keating had caused Lincoln to become insolvent . </s>
<s> Lincoln 's parent company , American Continental Corp. , entered bankruptcy-law proceedings this April 13 , and regulators seized the thrift the next day . </s>

<s> The toy makers , and their foreign buyers , cite uncertainty about China 's economic and political policies . </s>
<s> `` Nobody wants *-2 to have all his eggs in one basket , '' says *T*-1 David Yeh , chairman and chief executive officer of International Matchbox Group Ltd . </s>
<s> Indeed , Matchbox and other leading Hong Kong toy makers were setting up factories in Southeast Asia , especially in Thailand , long before the massacre . </s>
<s> Their steps were partly prompted *-1 by concern over a deterioration of business conditions in southern China . </s>
<s> By * diversifying supply sources , the toy makers do n't intend *-1 to withdraw from China , manufacturers and foreign buyers say 0 *T*-2 . </s>
<s> It *EXP*-1 would n't be easy * to duplicate quickly the manufacturing capacity built up in southern China during the past decade . </s>
<s> A supply of cheap labor and the access to Hong Kong 's port , airport , banks and support industries , such as printing companies , have made China 's Guangdong province a premier manufacturing site . </s>
<s> `` South China is the most competitive source of toys in the world , '' says *T*-1 Henry Hu , executive director of Wah Shing Toys Consolidated Ltd . </s>
<s> Hong Kong trade figures illustrate the toy makers ' reliance on factories across the border . </s>

<s> `` For the next few years , * like it or not , China is going *-1 to be the main supplier , '' says *T*-2 Edmund Young , vice president of Perfecta Enterprises Ltd. , one of the first big Hong Kong toy makers 0 *T*-3 to move across the border . </s>
<s> In the meantime , as manufacturers and buyers seek new sites , they are focusing mainly on Southeast Asia . </s>
<s> Several big companies have established manufacturing joint ventures in Thailand , including Matchbox , Wah Shing and Kader Industrial Co. , the toy manufacturer headed * by Mr. Ting . </s>
<s> Malaysia , the Philippines and Indonesia also are being studied *-1 . </s>
<s> With the European Community set *-1 to remove its internal trade barriers in 1992 , several Hong Kong companies are beginning *-2 to consider Spain , Portugal and Greece as possible manufacturing sites . </s>
<s> Worries about China came just as Hong Kong 's toy industry was recovering from a 1987 sales slump and bankruptcy filings by two major U.S. companies , Worlds of Wonder Inc. and Coleco Industries Inc . </s>
<s> Hong Kong manufacturers say 0 large debt writeoffs and other financial problems resulting from the 1987 difficulties chastened the local industry , * causing it to tighten credit policies and financial management . </s>
<s> The industry regards last year and this year as a period of recovery that *T*-1 will lead to improved results . </s>
<s> Still , they long for a `` mega-hit '' toy to excite retail sales in the U.S. , Hong Kong 's biggest market for toys and games . </s>

<s> Should sales continue *-2 to be strong through the Christmas season , which *T*-1 accounts for about 60 % of U.S. retail toy sales , Mr. Kwan said 0 the Ninja Turtles could make 1989 a record sales year for Playmates . </s>
<s> Other Hong Kong manufacturers expect their results to improve only slightly this year from 1988 . </s>
<s> Besides the lack of a fast-selling product , they cite the continued dominance of the U.S. market by Nintendo Entertainment System , an expensive video game made * by Nintendo Co. of Japan . </s>
<s> Nintendo buyers have little money left * to spend on other products . </s>
<s> Many of the toy makers ' problems started well before June 4 as a result of overstrained infrastructure and Beijing 's austerity programs launched * late last year . </s>
<s> Toy makers complain that electricity in Guangdong has been provided *-1 only three days a week in recent months , down from five days a week , as the province 's rapid industrialization has outstripped its generating capacity . </s>
<s> Manufacturers are upgrading standby power plants . </s>
<s> Bank credit for China investments all but dried up following June 4 . </s>
<s> Also , concern exists that the harder-line Beijing leadership will tighten its control of Guangdong , which *T*-1 has been the main laboratory for the open-door policy and economic reforms . </s>
<s> But , toy manufacturers and other industrialists say 0 Beijing will be restrained *-1 from * tightening controls on export-oriented southern China . </s>
<s> They say 0 China 's trade deficit is widening and the country is too short *ICH*-1 of foreign exchange for it to hamper production in Guangdong . </s>

<s> Both sides are *-1 to sit down next month for yet another meeting on how they might agree on * reducing fin-syn restraints *T*-2 . </s>

<s> The networks still are `` uninhibited in their authority '' over what shows *T*-1 get on the air , charges Motion Picture Association President Jack Valenti , the most vociferous opponent of * rescinding the rules . </s>
<s> Studios are `` powerless '' * to get shows in prime-time lineups and keep them there long enough * to go into lucrative rerun sales , he contends 0 *T*-1 . </s>
<s> And that 's why the rules , for the most part , must stay in place *T*-1 , he says 0 *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Studio executives in on the talks - including officials at Paramount Communications Inc. , Fries Entertainment Inc. , Warner Communications Inc. and MCA Inc. -- declined *-2 to be interviewed *-1 . </s>
<s> But Mr. Valenti , who *T*-1 represents the studios , asserts : `` 0 The whole production industry , to a man , is on the side of * preserving '' the rules . </s>

<s> `` They do n't seem *-1 to have an incentive * to negotiate , '' says *T*-2 one network executive . </s>
<s> `` And there 's no indication that Washington is prepared * to address the rules . </s>

<s> An NBC spokesman counters that Mr. Holston 's lament was `` entirely consistent '' with NBC plans because the U.S. rules would limit NBC 's involvement in the Qintex deal so severely as * to be `` light years away from the type of unrestrained deals available to Sony -- and everyone else except the three networks .

<s> The Big Three 's drumbeat for deregulation began *-1 intensifying in the summer when the former Time Inc. went ahead with plans *-3 to acquire Warner *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Although Time already had a long-term contract * to buy movies from Warner , the merger will let Time 's largely unregulated pay-cable channel , Home Box Office , own the Warner movies aired * on HBO -- a vertical integration that *T*-2 is effectively blocked *-1 by fin-syn regulations . </s>
<s> NBC 's Mr. Wright led the way in * decrying the networks ' inability * to match a Time-Warner combination . </s>

<s> Since NBC 's interest in the Qintex bid for MGM\/UA was disclosed *-1 , Mr. Wright has n't been available for comment . </s>
<s> With a Qintex deal , NBC would move into uncharted territory -- * possibly raising hackles at the studios and in Washington . </s>
<s> `` It 's never really been tested *-1 , '' says *T*-2 William Lilley III , who as a top CBS executive *T*-3 spent years *-4 lobbying * to have the rules lifted . </s>
<s> He now runs Policy Communications in Washington , * consulting to media companies . </s>
<s> Fin-syn rules do n't explicitly block a network from * buying a passive , small stake in a company that *T*-1 profits from the rerun syndication 0 networks ca n't enjoy *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Hence , NBC might be able * to take , * say , a 5 % stake in a company such as MGM\/UA . </s>
<s> If the transaction raised objections , the studio 's syndication operations could be spun off into a separate firm in which the network does n't have a direct stake *T*-1 . </s>
<s> But such convolutions would still block the networks from *-1 grabbing a big chunk of the riches of syndication . </s>
<s> Under current rules , even when a network fares well with a 100%-owned series -- ABC , for example , made a killing in *-2 broadcasting its popular crime\/comedy `` Moonlighting '' -- *T*-5 it is n't allowed *-3 to share in the continuing proceeds when the reruns are sold *-1 to local stations *T*-4 . </s>
<s> Instead , ABC will have *-1 to sell off the rights for a one-time fee . </s>

<s> Earning also fell from the year-ago period because of slowing microchip demand . </s>
<s> Sales amounted to $ 771.4 million *U* , down 1.7 % from $ 784.9 million *U* . </s>
<s> Intel 's stock rose in early over-the-counter trading Friday , as investors appeared relieved that the company 's income from continuing operations was only slightly below the second quarter 's earnings of $ 99.3 million *U* , or 53 cents a share , and that sales actually exceeded the $ 747.3 million *U* for the second period . </s>

<s> In August , Intel warned that third-quarter earnings might be `` flat to down '' from the previous period 's because of slowing sales growth of its 80386 microprocessor , start-up costs associated * with a line of computers and costs of * preparing for mass shipments of the company 's new 80486 chip in the current quarter . </s>
<s> On Friday , Andrew S.Grove , Intel president and chief executive officer , said 0 `` Intel 's business is strong . </s>

<s> Walter Sisulu and the African National Congress came home yesterday . </s>
<s> After 26 years in prison , Mr. Sisulu , the 77-year-old former secretary-general of the liberation movement , was dropped *-1 off at his house by a prison services ' van just as the sun was coming up . </s>
<s> At the same time , six ANC colleagues , five of whom *T*-2 were arrested *-3 with him in 1963 and sentenced *-3 to life imprisonment , were reunited *-1 with their families at various places around the country . </s>
<s> And as the graying men returned to their homes , the ANC , outlawed in South Africa since 1960 and still considered * to be the chief public enemy by the white government , defiantly returned to the streets of the country 's black townships . </s>
<s> A huge ANC flag , with black , green and gold stripes , was hoisted *-1 over the rickety gate at Mr. Sisulu 's modest house , while on the street out front , boys displayed the ANC colors on their shirts , caps and scarves . </s>
<s> At the small four-room home of Elias Motsoaledi , a leading ANC unionist and a former commander in the group 's armed wing , Umkhonto we Sizwe , well-wishers stuck little ANC flags in their hair and a man tooted on an antelope horn wrapped * in ANC ribbons . </s>
<s> `` I am happy * to see the spirit of the people , '' said *T*-1 Mr. Sisulu , * looking dapper in a new gray suit . </s>
<s> As the crowd outside his home shouted `` ANC , ANC , '' the old man shot his fists into the air . </s>
<s> `` I 'm inspired *-1 by the mood of the people . '' </s>
<s> Under the laws of the land , the ANC remains an illegal organization , and its headquarters are still in Lusaka , Zambia . </s>
<s> But the unconditional release of the seven leaders , who *T*-1 once formed the intellectual and organizational core of the ANC , is a de facto unbanning of the movement and the rebirth of its internal wing . </s>
<s> `` The government can never put the ANC back into the bottle again , '' said *T*-1 Cassim Saloojee , a veteran anti-apartheid activist on hand * to welcome Mr. Sisulu . </s>
<s> `` Things have gone too far for the government to stop them now . </s>
<s> There 's no * turning back . '' </s>
<s> There was certainly no * stopping the tide of ANC emotion last night , when hundreds of people jammed into the Holy Cross Anglican Church in Soweto for what *T*-1 became the first ANC rally in the country in 30 years *T*-2 . </s>
<s> Deafening chants of `` ANC '' and `` Umkhonto we Sizwe '' shook the church as the seven aging men vowed that the ANC would continue its fight against the government and the policies of racial segregation on all fronts , including the armed struggle . </s>
<s> And they called on the government *-2 to release Nelson Mandela , the ANC 's leading figure , who *T*-1 was jailed with them and remains in prison . </s>
<s> Without him , said 0 *T*-1 Mr. Sisulu , the freeing of the others `` is only a half-measure . '' </s>
<s> President F.W. de Klerk released the ANC men -- along with one of the founding members of the Pan Africanist Congress , a rival liberation group -- as part of his efforts * to create a climate of trust and peace in which his government can begin negotiations with black leaders over a new constitution aimed * at * giving blacks a voice in national government *T*-1 . </s>
<s> But Pretoria may instead be creating a climate for more turmoil and uncertainty in this racially divided country . </s>
<s> As other repressive governments , particularly Poland and the Soviet Union , have recently discovered , initial steps * to open up society can create a momentum for radical change that *T*-1 becomes difficult *RNR*-2 , if not impossible *RNR*-2 , * to control . </s>
<s> As the days go by , the South African government will be ever more hard pressed * to justify the continued imprisonment of Mr. Mandela as well as the continued banning of the ANC and enforcement of the state of emergency . </s>
<s> If it does n't yield on these matters , and eventually begin talking directly to the ANC , the expectations and promise raised * by yesterday 's releases will turn to disillusionment and unrest . </s>
<s> If it does , the large number of right-wing whites , who *T*-1 oppose any concessions to the black majority , will step up their agitation and threats * to take matters into their own hands . </s>
<s> The newly released ANC leaders also will be under enormous pressure . </s>
<s> The government is watching closely * to see if their presence in the townships leads to increased anti-government protests and violence ; if it does , Pretoria will use this as a reason 0 * to keep Mr. Mandela behind bars *T*-1 . </s>
<s> Pretoria has n't forgotten why they were all sentenced to life imprisonment in the first place : for sabotage and conspiracy to overthrow the government . </s>
<s> In addition , the government is figuring that the releases could create a split between the internal and external wings of the ANC and between the newly freed leaders and those activists who *T*-1 have emerged as leaders inside the country during their imprisonment . </s>
<s> In order * to head off any divisions , Mr. Mandela , in a meeting with his colleagues before they were released *-1 , instructed them *-2 to report to the ANC headquarters in Lusaka as soon as possible . </s>
<s> The men also will be faced *-1 with * bridging the generation gap between themselves and the country 's many militant black youths , the so-called young lions who *T*-2 are anxious * to see the old lions in action . </s>
<s> Says Peter Mokaba , president of the South African Youth Congress : `` We will be expecting them to act like leaders of the ANC . '' </s>
<s> They never considered themselves to be anything else . </s>
<s> At last night 's rally , they called on their followers * to be firm , yet disciplined , in their opposition to apartheid . </s>
<s> `` We emphasize discipline because we know that the government is very , very sensitive , '' said *T*-2 Andrew Mlangeni , another early Umkhonto leader who *T*-1 is now 63 . </s>
<s> `` We want * to see Nelson Mandela and all our comrades out of prison , and if we are n't disciplined *-1 we may not see them here with us . </s>
